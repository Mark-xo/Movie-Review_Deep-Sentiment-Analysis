One O
of O
the O
other O
reviewers O
has O
mentioned O
that O
after O
watching O
just O
1 O
Oz O
episode O
you'll O
be O
hooked. O
They O
are O
right, O
as O
this O
is O
exactly O
what O
happened O
with O
me.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
first O
thing O
that O
struck O
me O
about O
Oz O
was O
its O
brutality B-GENRE
and O
unflinching O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
of O
violence, B-GENRE
which O
set O
in O
right O
from O
the O
word O
GO. O
Trust O
me, O
this O
is O
not O
a O
show O
for O
the O
faint O
hearted O
or O
timid. O
This O
show O
pulls O
no O
punches O
with O
regards O
to O
drugs, O
sex O
or O
violence. B-GENRE
Its O
is O
hardcore, B-GENRE
in O
the O
classic B-GENRE
use O
of O
the O
word.<br O
/><br O
/>It O
is O
called O
OZ O
as O
that O
is O
the O
nickname O
given O
to O
the O
Oswald O
Maximum O
Security O
State O
Penitentary. O
It O
focuses O
mainly O
on O
Emerald O
City, O
an O
experimental O
section O
of O
the O
prison B-GENRE
where O
all O
the O
cells O
have O
glass O
fronts O
and O
face O
inwards, O
so O
privacy O
is O
not O
high O
on O
the O
agenda. O
Em O
City O
is O
home O
to O
many..Aryans, O
Muslims, O
gangstas, O
Latinos, O
Christians, O
Italians, O
Irish O
and O
more....so O
scuffles, O
death O
stares, O
dodgy O
dealings O
and O
shady O
agreements O
are O
never O
far O
away.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
would O
say O
the O
main O
appeal O
of O
the O
show O
is O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
goes O
where O
other O
shows O
wouldn't O
dare. O
Forget O
pretty O
pictures O
painted O
for O
mainstream O
audiences, O
forget O
charm, O
forget O
romance...OZ O
doesn't O
mess O
around. O
The O
first O
episode O
I O
ever O
saw O
struck O
me O
as O
so O
nasty O
it O
was O
surreal, B-TONE
I O
couldn't O
say O
I O
was O
ready O
for O
it, O
but O
as O
I O
watched O
more, O
I O
developed O
a O
taste O
for O
Oz, O
and O
got O
accustomed O
to O
the O
high O
levels O
of O
graphic B-TONE
violence. B-GENRE
Not O
just O
violence, B-GENRE
but O
injustice O
(crooked B-GENRE
guards O
who'll O
be O
sold O
out O
for O
a O
nickel, O
inmates O
who'll O
kill O
on O
order O
and O
get O
away O
with O
it, O
well O
mannered, O
middle O
class O
inmates O
being O
turned O
into O
prison B-GENRE
bitches O
due O
to O
their O
lack O
of O
street O
skills O
or O
prison B-GENRE
experience) O
Watching O
Oz, O
you O
may O
become O
comfortable O
with O
what O
is O
uncomfortable B-TONE
viewing....thats O
if O
you O
can O
get O
in O
touch O
with O
your O
darker O
side. O

A O
wonderful O
little O
production. O
<br O
/><br O
/>The O
filming O
technique B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
is O
very O
unassuming- O
very O
old-time-BBC O
fashion O
and O
gives O
a O
comforting, B-TONE
and O
sometimes O
discomforting, O
sense O
of O
realism B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
to O
the O
entire O
piece. O
<br O
/><br O
/>The O
actors O
are O
extremely O
well O
chosen- B-CLICHES
Michael O
Sheen B-CAST
not O
only O
"has O
got O
all O
the O
polari" O
but O
he O
has O
all O
the O
voices O
down O
pat O
too! O
You O
can O
truly O
see O
the O
seamless B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
editing B-DIRECTION
guided O
by O
the O
references O
to O
Williams' O
diary O
entries, O
not O
only O
is O
it O
well O
worth O
the O
watching O
but O
it O
is O
a O
terrificly O
written O
and O
performed O
piece. O
A O
masterful B-PERFORMANCE
production O
about O
one O
of O
the O
great O
master's O
of O
comedy B-GENRE
and O
his O
life. O
<br O
/><br O
/>The O
realism B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
really O
comes O
home O
with O
the O
little O
things: O
the O
fantasy B-GENRE
of O
the O
guard O
which, O
rather O
than O
use O
the O
traditional O
'dream' O
techniques O
remains O
solid O
then O
disappears. O
It O
plays O
on O
our O
knowledge O
and O
our O
senses, O
particularly O
with O
the O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
concerning O
Orton O
and O
Halliwell O
and O
the O
sets O
(particularly O
of O
their O
flat O
with O
Halliwell's O
murals O
decorating O
every O
surface) O
are O
terribly O
well O
done. O

I O
thought O
this O
was O
a O
wonderful O
way O
to O
spend O
time O
on O
a O
too O
hot O
summer O
weekend, O
sitting O
in O
the O
air O
conditioned O
theater O
and O
watching O
a O
light-hearted B-TONE
comedy. B-GENRE
The O
plot B-CLICHES
is O
simplistic, O
but O
the O
dialogue O
is O
witty O
and O
the O
characters B-CAST
are O
likable O
(even O
the O
well O
bread O
suspected O
serial O
killer). O
While O
some O
may O
be O
disappointed O
when O
they O
realize O
this O
is O
not O
Match O
Point O
2: O
Risk O
Addiction, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
proof O
that O
Woody O
Allen O
is O
still O
fully O
in O
control O
of O
the O
style O
many O
of O
us O
have O
grown O
to O
love.<br O
/><br O
/>This O
was O
the O
most O
I'd O
laughed O
at O
one O
of O
Woody's O
comedies O
in O
years O
(dare O
I O
say O
a O
decade?). O
While O
I've O
never O
been O
impressed O
with O
Scarlet O
Johanson, O
in O
this O
she O
managed O
to O
tone O
down O
her O
"sexy" O
image O
and O
jumped O
right O
into O
a O
average, B-PERFORMANCE
but O
spirited O
young O
woman.<br O
/><br O
/>This O
may O
not O
be O
the O
crown O
jewel O
of O
his O
career, O
but O
it O
was O
wittier O
than O
"Devil O
Wears O
Prada" O
and O
more O
interesting O
than O
"Superman" O
a O
great O
comedy B-GENRE
to O
go O
see O
with O
friends. O

Basically O
there's O
a O
family B-FRANCHISE
where O
a O
little O
boy O
(Jake) O
thinks O
there's O
a O
zombie O
in O
his O
closet O
& O
his O
parents O
are O
fighting O
all O
the O
time.<br O
/><br O
/>This O
movie O
is O
slower O
than O
a O
soap B-GENRE
opera... O
and O
suddenly, O
Jake O
decides O
to O
become O
Rambo O
and O
kill O
the O
zombie.<br O
/><br O
/>OK, O
first O
of O
all O
when O
you're O
going O
to O
make O
a O
film O
you O
must O
Decide O
if O
its O
a O
thriller B-GENRE
or O
a O
drama! B-GENRE
As O
a O
drama B-GENRE
the O
movie O
is O
watchable. O
Parents O
are O
divorcing O
& O
arguing O
like O
in O
real O
life. O
And O
then O
we O
have O
Jake O
with O
his O
closet O
which O
totally O
ruins O
all O
the O
film! O
I O
expected O
to O
see O
a O
BOOGEYMAN O
similar O
movie, O
and O
instead O
i O
watched O
a O
drama B-GENRE
with O
some O
meaningless O
thriller B-GENRE
spots.<br O
/><br O
/>3 O
out O
of O
10 O
just O
for O
the O
well O
playing O
parents O
& O
descent B-STORY
dialogs. O
As O
for O
the O
shots B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
with O
Jake: O
just O
ignore O
them. O

Petter O
Mattei's O
"Love O
in O
the O
Time O
of O
Money" O
is O
a O
visually O
stunning O
film O
to O
watch. O
Mr. O
Mattei O
offers O
us O
a O
vivid B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
portrait O
about O
human O
relations. O
This O
is O
a O
movie O
that O
seems O
to O
be O
telling O
us O
what O
money, O
power O
and O
success O
do O
to O
people O
in O
the O
different O
situations O
we O
encounter. O
<br O
/><br O
/>This O
being O
a O
variation O
on O
the O
Arthur O
Schnitzler's O
play O
about O
the O
same O
theme, B-MUSIC
the O
director B-DIRECTION
transfers O
the O
action B-GENRE
to O
the O
present O
time O
New O
York O
where O
all O
these O
different O
characters B-CAST
meet O
and O
connect. O
Each O
one O
is O
connected O
in O
one O
way, O
or O
another O
to O
the O
next O
person, O
but O
no O
one O
seems O
to O
know O
the O
previous O
point O
of O
contact. O
Stylishly, O
the O
film O
has O
a O
sophisticated O
luxurious O
look. O
We O
are O
taken O
to O
see O
how O
these O
people O
live O
and O
the O
world O
they O
live O
in O
their O
own O
habitat.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
only O
thing O
one O
gets O
out O
of O
all O
these O
souls O
in O
the O
picture O
is O
the O
different O
stages O
of O
loneliness O
each O
one O
inhabits. O
A O
big O
city O
is O
not O
exactly O
the O
best O
place O
in O
which O
human O
relations O
find O
sincere O
fulfillment, O
as O
one O
discerns O
is O
the O
case O
with O
most O
of O
the O
people O
we O
encounter.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
acting B-CAST
is O
good B-CAST
under O
Mr. O
Mattei's O
direction. B-DIRECTION
Steve O
Buscemi, O
Rosario O
Dawson, B-CAST
Carol O
Kane, O
Michael O
Imperioli, O
Adrian O
Grenier, O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
talented O
cast, B-CAST
make O
these O
characters B-CAST
come O
alive.<br O
/><br O
/>We O
wish O
Mr. O
Mattei O
good B-CAST
luck O
and O
await O
anxiously O
for O
his O
next O
work. O

Probably O
my O
all-time O
favorite O
movie, O
a O
story B-STORY
of O
selflessness, B-GENRE
sacrifice B-GENRE
and O
dedication O
to O
a O
noble B-GENRE
cause, O
but O
it's O
not O
preachy O
or O
boring. B-TONE
It O
just O
never O
gets O
old, O
despite O
my O
having O
seen O
it O
some O
15 O
or O
more O
times O
in O
the O
last O
25 O
years. O
Paul O
Lukas' O
performance B-CAST
brings O
tears O
to O
my O
eyes, O
and O
Bette O
Davis, B-CAST
in O
one O
of O
her O
very O
few O
truly O
sympathetic O
roles, O
is O
a O
delight. O
The O
kids O
are, O
as O
grandma O
says, O
more O
like O
"dressed-up O
midgets" O
than O
children, O
but O
that O
only O
makes O
them O
more O
fun B-PERFORMANCE
to O
watch. O
And O
the O
mother's O
slow B-TONE
awakening B-STORY
to O
what's O
happening O
in O
the O
world O
and O
under O
her O
own O
roof O
is O
believable B-PERFORMANCE
and O
startling. O
If O
I O
had O
a O
dozen O
thumbs, O
they'd O
all O
be O
"up" O
for O
this O
movie. O

I O
sure O
would O
like O
to O
see O
a O
resurrection O
of O
a O
up O
dated B-CLICHES
Seahunt O
series B-FRANCHISE
with O
the O
tech O
they O
have O
today O
it O
would O
bring O
back O
the O
kid O
excitement O
in O
me.I O
grew O
up O
on O
black B-HUMOR
and O
white O
TV O
and O
Seahunt O
with O
Gunsmoke O
were O
my O
hero's O
every O
week.You O
have O
my O
vote O
for O
a O
comeback O
of O
a O
new O
sea O
hunt.We O
need O
a O
change O
of O
pace O
in O
TV O
and O
this O
would O
work O
for O
a O
world O
of O
under O
water O
adventure.Oh O
by O
the O
way O
thank O
you O
for O
an O
outlet O
like O
this O
to O
view O
many O
viewpoints O
about O
TV O
and O
the O
many O
movies.So O
any O
ole O
way O
I O
believe O
I've O
got O
what O
I O
wanna O
say.Would O
be O
nice O
to O
read O
some O
more O
plus O
points O
about O
sea O
hunt.If O
my O
rhymes O
would O
be O
10 O

would O
you O
let O
me O
submit,or O
leave O
me O
out O
to O
be O
in O
doubt O
and O
have O
me O
to O
quit,If O
this O
is O
so O
then O
I O
must O
go O
so O
lets O
do O
it. O

This O
show O
was O
an O
amazing, O
fresh O
& O
innovative O
idea O
in O
the O
70's O
when O
it O
first O
aired. O
The O
first O
7 O
or O
8 O
years O
were O
brilliant, O
but O
things O
dropped O
off O
after O
that. O
By O
1990, O
the O
show O
was O
not O
really O
funny B-HUMOR
anymore, O
and O
it's O
continued O
its O
decline O
further O
to O
the O
complete O
waste O
of O
time O
it O
is O
today.<br O
/><br O
/>It's O
truly O
disgraceful O
how O
far O
this O
show O
has O
fallen. O
The O
writing B-STORY
is O
painfully O
bad, O
the O
performances O
are O
almost O
as O
bad O
- O
if O
not O
for O
the O
mildly O
entertaining O
respite O
of O
the O
guest-hosts, O
this O
show O
probably O
wouldn't O
still O
be O
on O
the O
air. O
I O
find O
it O
so O
hard O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
same O
creator O
that O
hand-selected O
the O
original O
cast B-CAST
also O
chose O
the O
band O
of O
hacks O
that O
followed. O
How O
can O
one O
recognize O
such O
brilliance O
and O
then O
see O
fit O
to O
replace O
it O
with O
such O
mediocrity? O
I O
felt O
I O
must O
give O
2 O
stars O
out O
of O
respect O
for O
the O
original O
cast B-CAST
that O
made O
this O
show O
such O
a O
huge O
success. O
As O
it O
is O
now, O
the O
show O
is O
just O
awful. O
I O
can't O
believe O
it's O
still O
on O
the O
air. O

Encouraged O
by O
the O
positive O
comments O
about O
this O
film O
on O
here O
I O
was O
looking O
forward O
to O
watching O
this O
film. O
Bad O
mistake. O
I've O
seen O
950+ O
films O
and O
this O
is O
truly O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
of O
them O
- O
it's O
awful O
in O
almost O
every O
way: O
editing, B-DIRECTION
pacing, B-DIRECTION
storyline, O
'acting,' B-CAST
soundtrack B-MUSIC
(the O
film's O
only O
song O
- O
a O
lame O
country B-MUSIC
tune O
- O
is O
played O
no O
less O
than O
four O
times). O
The O
film O
looks O
cheap B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
and O
nasty O
and O
is O
boring B-TONE
in O
the O
extreme. O
Rarely O
have O
I O
been O
so O
happy O
to O
see O
the O
end O
credits O
of O
a O
film. O
<br O
/><br O
/>The O
only O
thing O
that O
prevents O
me O
giving O
this O
a O
1-score O
is O
Harvey O
Keitel O
- O
while O
this O
is O
far O
from O
his O
best O
performance B-CAST
he O
at O
least O
seems O
to O
be O
making O
a O
bit O
of O
an O
effort. O
One O
for O
Keitel O
obsessives O
only. O

If O
you O
like O
original O
gut O
wrenching O
laughter B-HUMOR
you O
will O
like O
this O
movie. O
If O
you O
are O
young O
or O
old O
then O
you O
will O
love O
this O
movie, O
hell O
even O
my O
mom O
liked O
it.<br O
/><br O
/>Great O
Camp!!! O

Phil O
the O
Alien O
is O
one O
of O
those O
quirky B-HUMOR
films O
where O
the O
humour O
is O
based O
around O
the O
oddness O
of O
everything O
rather O
than O
actual O
punchlines.<br O
/><br O
/>At O
first O
it O
was O
very O
odd O
and O
pretty O
funny B-HUMOR
but O
as O
the O
movie O
progressed O
I O
didn't O
find O
the O
jokes O
or O
oddness O
funny B-HUMOR
anymore.<br O
/><br O
/>Its O
a O
low O
budget O
film O
(thats O
never O
a O
problem O
in O
itself), O
there O
were O
some O
pretty O
interesting O
characters, B-CAST
but O
eventually O
I O
just O
lost O
interest.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
imagine O
this O
film O
would O
appeal O
to O
a O
stoner O
who O
is O
currently O
partaking.<br O
/><br O
/>For O
something O
similar O
but O
better O
try O
"Brother O
from O
another O
planet" O

I O
saw O
this O
movie O
when O
I O
was O
about O
12 O
when O
it O
came O
out. O
I O
recall O
the O
scariest O
scene O
was O
the O
big O
bird O
eating O
men O
dangling O
helplessly O
from O
parachutes O
right O
out O
of O
the O
air. O
The O
horror. B-GENRE
The O
horror.<br O
/><br O
/>As O
a O
young O
kid O
going O
to O
these O
cheesy B-HUMOR
B O
films O
on O
Saturday O
afternoons, O
I O
still O
was O
tired O
of O
the O
formula O
for O
these O
monster O
type O
movies O
that O
usually O
included O
the O
hero, B-CLICHES
a O
beautiful O
woman O
who O
might O
be O
the O
daughter O
of O
a O
professor O
and O
a O
happy O
resolution O
when O
the O
monster O
died O
in O
the O
end. O
I O
didn't O
care O
much O
for O
the O
romantic B-FRANCHISE
angle O
as O
a O
12 O
year O
old O
and O
the O
predictable B-CLICHES
plots. O
I O
love O
them O
now O
for O
the O
unintentional B-HUMOR
humor.<br O
/><br O
/>But, O
about O
a O
year O
or O
so O
later, O
I O
saw O
Psycho O
when O
it O
came O
out O
and O
I O
loved O
that O
the O
star, O
Janet O
Leigh, O
was O
bumped O
off O
early O
in O
the O
film. O
I O
sat O
up O
and O
took O
notice O
at O
that O
point. O
Since O
screenwriters O
are O
making O
up O
the O
story, B-STORY
make O
it O
up O
to O
be O
as O
scary O
as O
possible O
and O
not O
from O
a O
well-worn O
formula. O
There O
are O
no O
rules. O

So O
im O
not O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
Boll's O
work O
but O
then O
again O
not O
many O
are. O
I O
enjoyed O
his O
movie O
Postal O
(maybe O
im O
the O
only O
one). O
Boll O
apparently O
bought O
the O
rights O
to O
use O
Far O
Cry O
long O
ago O
even O
before O
the O
game O
itself O
was O
even O
finsished. O
<br O
/><br O
/>People O
who O
have O
enjoyed O
killing O
mercs O
and O
infiltrating O
secret O
research O
labs O
located O
on O
a O
tropical O
island O
should O
be O
warned, O
that O
this O
is O
not O
Far O
Cry... O
This O
is O
something O
Mr O
Boll O
have O
schemed O
together O
along O
with O
his O
legion O
of O
schmucks.. O
Feeling O
loneley O
on O
the O
set O
Mr O
Boll O
invites O
three O
of O
his O
countrymen O
to O
play O
with. O
These O
players O
go O
by O
the O
names O
of O
Til O
Schweiger, O
Udo O
Kier O
and O
Ralf O
Moeller.<br O
/><br O
/>Three O
names O
that O
actually O
have O
made O
them O
selfs O
pretty O
big O
in O
the O
movie O
biz. O
So O
the O
tale O
goes O
like O
this, O
Jack O
Carver O
played O
by O
Til O
Schweiger O
(yes O
Carver O
is O
German O
all O
hail O
the O
bratwurst O
eating O
dudes!!) O
However O
I O
find O
that O
Tils O
acting B-CAST
in O
this O
movie O
is O
pretty O
badass.. B-PERFORMANCE
People O
have O
complained O
about O
how O
he's O
not O
really O
staying O
true O
to O
the O
whole O
Carver O
agenda O
but O
we O
only O
saw O
carver O
in O
a O
first O
person O
perspective O
so O
we O
don't O
really O
know O
what O
he O
looked O
like O
when O
he O
was O
kicking O
a**.. O
<br O
/><br O
/>However, O
the O
storyline O
in O
this O
film O
is O
beyond O
demented. O
We O
see O
the O
evil O
mad O
scientist O
Dr. O
Krieger O
played O
by O
Udo O
Kier, O
making O
Genetically-Mutated-soldiers O
or O
GMS O
as O
they O
are O
called. O
Performing O
his O
top-secret O
research O
on O
an O
island O
that O
reminds O
me O
of O
"SPOILER" O
Vancouver O
for O
some O
reason. O
Thats O
right O
no O
palm O
trees O
here. O
Instead O
we O
got O
some O
nice O
rich B-CLICHES
lumberjack-woods. O
We O
haven't O
even O
gone O
FAR O
before O
I O
started O
to O
CRY O
(mehehe) O
I O
cannot O
go O
on O
any O
more.. O
If O
you O
wanna O
stay O
true O
to O
Bolls O
shenanigans O
then O
go O
and O
see O
this O
movie O
you O
will O
not O
be O
disappointed O
it O
delivers O
the O
true O
Boll O
experience, O
meaning O
most O
of O
it O
will O
suck.<br O
/><br O
/>There O
are O
some O
things O
worth O
mentioning O
that O
would O
imply O
that O
Boll O
did O
a O
good B-CAST
work O
on O
some O
areas O
of O
the O
film O
such O
as O
some O
nice O
boat O
and O
fighting O
scenes. B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
Until O
the O
whole O
cromed/albino O
GMS O
squad O
enters O
the O
scene O
and O
everything O
just O
makes O
me O
laugh.. O
The O
movie O
Far O
Cry O
reeks O
of O
scheisse O
(that's O
poop O
for O
you O
simpletons) O
from O
a O
fa,r O
if O
you O
wanna O
take O
a O
wiff O
go O
ahead.. O
BTW O
Carver O
gets O
a O
very O
annoying O
sidekick O
who O
makes O
you O
wanna O
shoot O
him O
the O
first O
three O
minutes O
he's O
on O
screen. O

The O
cast B-CAST
played O
Shakespeare.<br O
/><br O
/>Shakespeare O
lost.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
appreciate O
that O
this O
is O
trying O
to O
bring O
Shakespeare O
to O
the O
masses, O
but O
why O
ruin O
something O
so O
good.<br O
/><br O
/>Is O
it O
because O
'The O
Scottish O
Play' O
is O
my O
favorite O
Shakespeare? O
I O
do O
not O
know. O
What O
I O
do O
know O
is O
that O
a O
certain O
Rev O
Bowdler O
(hence O
bowdlerization) O
tried O
to O
do O
something O
similar O
in O
the O
Victorian O
era.<br O
/><br O
/>In O
other O
words, O
you O
cannot O
improve O
perfection.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
have O
no O
more O
to O
write O
but O
as O
I O
have O
to O
write O
at O
least O
ten O
lines O
of O
text O
(and O
English O
composition B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
was O
never O
my O
forte O
I O
will O
just O
have O
to O
keep O
going O
and O
say O
that O
this O
movie, O
as O
the O
saying O
goes, O
just O
does O
not O
cut O
it. O

This O
a O
fantastic O
movie O
of O
three O
prisoners O
who O
become O
famous. O
One O
of O
the O
actors O
is O
george O
clooney O
and O
I'm O
not O
a O
fan O
but O
this O
roll O
is O
not O
bad. O
Another O
good B-CAST
thing O
about O
the O
movie O
is O
the O
soundtrack B-MUSIC
(The O
man O
of O
constant B-MUSIC
sorrow). O
I O
recommand O
this O
movie O
to O
everybody. O
Greetings O
Bart O

Kind O
of O
drawn O
in O
by O
the O
erotic O
scenes, B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
only O
to O
realize O
this O
was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
amateurish B-TONE
and O
unbelievable O
bits O
of O
film O
I've O
ever O
seen. O
Sort O
of O
like O
a O
high O
school O
film O
project. O
What O
was O
Rosanna O
Arquette O
thinking?? O
And O
what O
was O
with O
all O
those O
stock O
characters B-CAST
in O
that O
bizarre O
supposed O
Midwest O
town? O
Pretty O
hard O
to O
get O
involved O
with O
this O
one. O
No O
lessons O
to O
be O
learned O
from O
it, O
no O
brilliant O
insights, O
just O
stilted B-PERFORMANCE
and O
quite O
ridiculous B-TONE
(but O
lots O
of O
skin, O
if O
that O
intrigues O
you) O
videotaped O
nonsense....What O
was O
with O
the O
bisexual O
relationship, O
out O
of O
nowhere, O
after O
all O
the O
heterosexual O
encounters. O
And O
what O
was O
with O
that O
absurd B-HUMOR
dance, O
with O
everybody O
playing O
their O
stereotyped O
roles? O
Give O
this O
one O
a O
pass, O
it's O
like O
a O
million O
other O
miles O
of O
bad, O
wasted O
film, O
money O
that O
could O
have O
been O
spent O
on O
starving O
children O
or O
Aids O
in O
Africa..... O

Some O
films O
just O
simply O
should O
not O
be O
remade. O
This O
is O
one O
of O
them. O
In O
and O
of O
itself O
it O
is O
not O
a O
bad O
film. O
But O
it O
fails O
to O
capture O
the O
flavor O
and O
the O
terror O
of O
the O
1963 O
film O
of O
the O
same O
title. O
Liam O
Neeson O
was O
excellent O
as O
he O
always O
is, O
and O
most O
of O
the O
cast B-CAST
holds O
up, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
Owen O
Wilson, O
who O
just O
did O
not O
bring O
the O
right O
feel O
to O
the O
character O
of O
Luke. O
But O
the O
major O
fault O
with O
this O
version O
is O
that O
it O
strayed O
too O
far O
from O
the O
Shirley O
Jackson O
story B-STORY
in O
it's O
attempts O
to O
be O
grandiose O
and O
lost O
some O
of O
the O
thrill O
of O
the O
earlier O
film O
in O
a O
trade B-FRANCHISE
off O
for O
snazzier O
special B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
effects. O
Again O
I O
will O
say O
that O
in O
and O
of O
itself O
it O
is O
not O
a O
bad O
film. O
But O
you O
will O
enjoy O
the O
friction O
of O
terror O
in O
the O
older O
version O
much O
more. O

This O
movie O
made O
it O
into O
one O
of O
my O
top O
10 O
most O
awful O
movies. O
Horrible. O

There O
was O

I O
remember O
this O

was O
the O
first O

i O
had O
watched O
at O
the O
cinema O
the O
picture O
was O
dark B-HUMOR
in O

i O

it O
was O
back O

took O
me O
my O

sister O
to O

I O
recall O
the O
tigers O

the O

also O
the O
appearance O
of O

one O

anyone O
knows O
where O
to O
find O
this O
on O
DVD O
etc O
please O
let O
me O
know.The O
cinema O
now O
has O
been O
turned O
in O
a O
fitness O
club O
which O
is O
a O
very O
big O
shame O
as O
the O
nearest O
cinema O
now O
is O
20 O
miles O
away, O
would O
love O
to O
hear O
from O
others O
who O
have O
seen O
this O
film O
or O
any O
other O
like O
it. O

An O
awful O
film! O
It O
must O
have O
been O
up O
against O
some O
real O
stinkers O
to O
be O
nominated O
for O
the O
Golden O
Globe. O
They've O
taken O
the O
story B-STORY
of O
the O
first O
famous O
female O
Renaissance O
painter O
and O
mangled O
it O
beyond O
recognition. O
My O
complaint O
is O
not O
that O
they've O
taken O
liberties O
with O
the O
facts; O
if O
the O
story B-STORY
were O
good, B-CAST
that O
would O
perfectly O
fine. O
But O
it's O
simply O
bizarre O
-- O
by O
all O
accounts O
the O
true O
story B-STORY
of O
this O
artist O
would O
have O
made O
for O
a O
far O
better O
film, O
so O
why O
did O
they O
come O
up O
with O
this O
dishwater-dull O
script? B-STORY
I O
suppose O
there O
weren't O
enough O
naked O
people O
in O
the O
factual O
version. O
It's O
hurriedly O
capped O
off O
in O
the O
end O
with O
a O
summary O
of O
the O
artist's O
life O
-- O
we O
could O
have O
saved O
ourselves O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
if O
they'd O
favored O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
film O
with O
same O
brevity. O

After O
the O
success O
of O
Die O
Hard O
and O
it's O
sequels O
it's O
no O
surprise O
really O
that O
in O
the O
1990s, O
a O
glut O
of O
'Die O

cashed O
in O
on O
the O
wrong O

That O
is O
what O
they O
did O

are O

at O

All O

full O

Stallone O

However, O

all O

it's O
actually O
a O

I O
had O
the O
terrible O

I O
have O
to O
say O
is--- O
save O
your O
time O

money!!! O
This O
has O
got O
to O
be O
the O
worst O
b-movie O
of O
all O
time, O
it O
shouldn't O
even O
be O
called O
a O
b-movie, O
more O
like O
an O
f-movie! O
Because O
it O
fails O
in O
all O
aspects O
that O
make O
a O
good B-CAST
movie: O
the O
story B-STORY
is O
not O
interesting O
at O
all, O
all O
of O
the O
actors O
are O
paper-thin O
and O
not O
at O
all O
believable, B-PERFORMANCE
it O
has O
bad O
direction B-DIRECTION
and O
the O
action B-GENRE
sequences O
are O
so O
fake O
it's O
almost O
funny.......almost.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
movie O
is O
just O
packed O
full O
of O
crappy O
one-liners O
that O
no O
respectable O
person O
could O
find O
amusing O
in O
the O
least O
little O
bit.<br O
/><br O

movie O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
geared O
towards O
men, O
but O
all O
the O
women O
in O
it O
are O
SO O
utterly O
unattractive, O
especially O
that O
old O
wrinkled O
thing O
that O
comes O
in O

the O
end. O
They O
try O
to O
appear O
sexy O
in O
those O
weird, O
horrible O

they O
fail O
miserably!!!<br O

some O
of O
the O
most O
ridiculous B-TONE
b-movies O
will O
still O
give O
you O
some O
laughs, O
but O
this O
is O
just O
too O
painful O
to O
watch!! O

What O
an O
absolutely O
stunning O
movie, O
if O
you O
have O
2.5 O
hrs O
to O
kill, O
watch O
it, O
you O
won't O
regret O
it, O
it's O
too O
much O
fun! B-PERFORMANCE
Rajnikanth O

there O
isn't O

him, O
I O
still O
liked O
it. O
The O
music B-MUSIC
by O
A.R.Rehman O
takes O
time O
to O
grow O
on O
you O
but O
after O
you O
heard O
it O
a O
few O
times, O
you O
really O
start O
liking O
it. O

First O
of O
all, O
let's O
get O
a O
few O
things O
straight O
here: O
a) O
I O
AM O
an O
anime O
fan- O
always O
has O
been O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
(I O
used O
to O
watch O
Speed O
Racer O
all O
the O
time O
in O
Preschool). O
b) O
I O
DO O
like O
several O
B-Movies O
because O
they're O
hilarious. B-TONE
c) O
I O
like O
the O
Godzilla O
movies- O
a O
lot.<br O
/><br O
/>Moving O
on, O
when O
the O
movie O
first O
comes O
on, O
it O
seems O
like O
it's O
going O
to O
be O
your O
usual O
B-movie, O
down O
to O
the O
crappy O
FX, O
but O
all O
a O
sudden- O
BOOM! O
the O
anime O
comes O
on! O
This O
is O
when O
the O
movie O
goes O
WWWAAAAAYYYYY O
downhill.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
animation O
is O
VERY O
bad O
& O
cheap, B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
even O
worse O
than O
what O
I O
remember O
from O
SPEED O
RACER, O
for O
crissakes! O
In O
fact, O
it's O
so O
cheap, B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
one O
of O
the O
few O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
from O
the O
movie O
I O
"vividly" O
remember O
is O
when O
a O
bunch O
of O
kids O
run O
out O
of O
a O
school... O
& O
it's O
the O
same O
kids O
over O
& O
over O
again! O
The O
FX O
are O
terrible, O
too; O
the O
dinosaurs O
look O
worse O
than O
Godzilla. O
In O
addition, O
the O
transition O
to O
live O
action B-GENRE
to O
animation O
is O
unorganized, O
the O
dialogue O
& O
voices(especially O
the O
English O
dub O
that O
I O
viewed) O
was O
horrid O
& O
I O
was O
begging O
my O
dad O
to O
take O
the O
tape O
out O
of O
the O
DVD/ O
VHS O
player; O
The O
only O
thing O
that O
kept O
me O
surviving O
was O
cracking O
out O
jokes O
& O
comments O
like O
the O
robots O
& O
Joel/Mike O
on O
MST3K O
(you O
pick O
the O
season). O
Honestly, O
this O
is O
the O
only O
way O
to O
barely O
enjoy O
this O
movie O
& O
survive O
it O
at O
the O
same O
time.<br O
/><br O
/>Heck, O
I'm O
planning O
to O
show O
this O
to O
another O
fellow O
otaku O
pal O
of O
mine O
on O
Halloween O
for O
a O
B-Movie O
night. B-STORY
Because O
it's O
stupid, O
pretty O
painful O
to O
watch O
& O
unintentionally O
hilarious B-TONE
at O
the O
same O
time, O
I'm O
giving O
this O
movie O
a O
3/10, O
an O
improvement O
from O
the O
0.5/10 O
I O
was O
originally O
going O
to O
give O
it.<br O
/><br O
/>(According O
to O
my O
grading O
scale: O
3/10 O
means O
Pretty O
much O
both O
boring B-TONE
& O
bad. O
As O
fun B-PERFORMANCE

counting O
to O
three O
unless O
you O
find O
a O
way O
to O
make O

of O
it, O
then O
it O
will O
become O
as O
fun B-PERFORMANCE
as O
counting O
to O
15.) O

This O
was O
the O
worst O
movie O
I O
saw O
at O
WorldFest O
and O
it O
also O
received O
the O
least O
amount O
of O
applause O
afterwards! O
I O
can O
only O
think O
it O
is O
receiving O
such O
recognition O
based O
on O
the O
amount O
of O
known O
actors O
in O
the O
film. O
It's O
great O
to O
see O
J.Beals O
but O
she's O
only O
in O
the O
movie O
for O
a O
few O
minutes. O
M.Parker O
is O
a O
much O
better O
actress B-CAST
than O
the O
part O
allowed O
for. O
The O
rest O
of O
the O
acting B-CAST
is O
hard O
to O
judge O
because O
the O
movie O
is O
so O
ridiculous B-TONE
and O
predictable. B-CLICHES
The O
main O
character O
is O
totally O
unsympathetic O
and O
therefore O
a O
bore O
to O
watch. O
There O
is O
no O
real O
emotional O
depth O
to O
the O
story. B-STORY
A O
movie O
revolving O
about O
an O
actor B-CAST
who O
can't O
get O
work O
doesn't O
feel O
very O
original O
to O
me. O
Nor O
does O
the O
development O
of O
the O
cop. O
It O
feels O
like O
one O
of O
many O
straight-to-video O
movies O
I O
saw O
back O
in O
the O
90s O
... O

not O

in O
those O

about O

, O
but O
plays O
a O
very O
naive O
and O
sort O
of O
dumb O
Karen O
Carpenter. O
I O
think O
that O
the O
role O
needed O
a O
stronger O

"The O

an O
exotic O

into O
not O

what O
can O
be O
achieved O
if O
human O

This O

boldness O

pushing O
aside O

read O
numerous O
complaints O

To O
negatively O

just O
opened O
the O

So O
can O
we O
slam O
the O
door O
in O

tell O
it O

its O

we O
don't O
want O

of O
a O
serial O
killer, O
and O
yes, O
I O
do O
agree O
that O
the O
"genre" O
is O
a O
bit O
overworked. O
The O
90s O
were O
full O
of O
movies O
trying O
to O
depict O
what O
makes O
serial O
killers O
tick; O
some O
of O
them O
worked, O
but O
most O
failed. O
But O
"The O
Cell" O
does O
not O
blaze O
down O
the O
same O
trail, O
we O
are O
given O
a O
new O
twist, B-CLICHES
we O
are O
physically O
transported O
into O
the O
mind O
and O
presented O
with O
nothing O
less O
than O
a O
fascinating O
journey B-STORY
of O
the O
most O
mysterious O
subject O
matter O
ever O
studied.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
like O
how O
the O
movie O
does O
not O
bog O
us O
down O
with O
too O
much O
scientific O
jargon O
trying O
to O
explain O
how O
Jennifer O
Lopez O
actually O
gets O
to O
enter O
the O
brain O
of O
another. O
Instead, O
she O
just O
lies O
down O
on O
a O
laboratory O
table O
and O
is O
wrapped O
with O
what O
looks O
like O
really O
long O
Twizzlers O
and O
jaunted O
into O
another O
entity. O
"The O
Cell" O
wants O
to O
let O
you O
"see" O
what O
it's O
all O
about O
and O
not O
"how" O
it's O
all O
about, O
and O
I O
guess O
that's O
what O
some O
people O
don't O
like. O
True, O
I O
do O
like O
explanations O
with O
my O
movies, O
but O
when O
a O
movie O
ventures O
onto O
new O
ground O
you O
must O
let O
it O
do O
what O
it O
desires O
and O
simply O
take O
it O
in.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
noticed O
how O
the O
film O
was O
very O
dark B-HUMOR
when O
it O
showed O
reality, O
maybe O
to O
contrast O
the O
bright O
visuals B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
when O
inside O
the O
brain O
of O
another. O
Nonetheless, O
the O
set O
design B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
was O
simply O
astonishing. O
I O
wouldn't O
be O
surprised O
if O
this O
film O
took O
home O
a O
few O
Oscars O
in O
cinematography, B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
best O
costumes, O
best O
director B-DIRECTION
and O
the O
like. O
If O
it O
were O
up O
to O
me O
it'd O
at O
least O
get O
nominated O
for O
best O
picture.<br O
/><br O
/>I've O
noticed O
that O
I've O
kind O
of O
been O
repeating O
myself. O
Not O
because O
there's O
nothing O
else O
to O
say, O
but O
because O
I O
can't O
stress O
enough O
how O
fantastic O
I O
thought O
"The O
Cell" O
was. O
If O
you O
walk O
into O
the O
movie O
with O
a O
very O
open O
mind O
and O
to O
have O
it O
taken O
over O
with O
wonders O
and O
an O
eye-popping O
feast O
then O
you O
are O
assured O
a O
good B-CAST
time. O
I O
guess O
this O
film O
was O
just O
a O
little O
too O
much O
for O
some O
people, O
writing B-STORY
it O
off O
as O
"weird" O
or O
"crazy". O
I O
am O
very O
much O
into O
psychology O
and O
the O
imagination O
of O
the O
human O
mind, O
so O
it O
was O
right O
down O
my O
alley. O
Leaving O
the O
theater, O
I O
heard O
one O
audience O
member O
say O
"Whoever O
made O
that O
movie O
sure O
did O
a O
lot O
of O
good B-CAST
drugs." O
If O
so, O
I O
want O
what O
he O
was O
smoking.<br O

This O
film O
tried O
to O
be O
too O
many O
things O
all O
at O
once: O
stinging O
political B-GENRE
satire, B-HUMOR
Hollywood O
blockbuster, O
sappy O
romantic B-FRANCHISE
comedy, B-GENRE
family B-FRANCHISE
values O
promo... O
the O
list O
goes O
on O
and O
on. O
It O
failed O
miserably O
at O
all O
of O
them, O
but O
there O
was O
enough O
interest O
to O
keep O
me O
from O
turning O
it O
off O
until O
the O
end.<br O
/><br O
/>Although O
I O
appreciate O
the O
spirit O
behind O
WAR, B-GENRE
INC., O
it O
depresses O
me O
to O
see O
such O
a O
clumsy O
effort, O
especially O
when O
it O
will O
be O
taken O
by O
its O
targets O
to O
reflect O
the O
lack O
of O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
serious O
critique, O
rather O
than O
simply O
the O
poor O
writing, B-STORY
direction, B-DIRECTION
and O
production O
of O
this O
particular O
film.<br O
/><br O
/>There O
is O
a O
critique O
to O
be O
made O
about O
the O
corporatization O
of O
war. B-GENRE
But O
poking O
fun B-PERFORMANCE
at O
it O
in O
this O
way O
diminishes O
the O
true O
atrocity O
of O
what O
is O
happening. O
Reminds O
me O
a O
bit O
of O
THREE O
KINGS, O
which O
similarly O
trivializes O
a O
genuine O
cause O
for O
concern. O

This O
movie O
was O
so O
frustrating. O
Everything O
seemed O
energetic O
and O
I O
was O
totally O
prepared O
to O
have O
a O
good B-CAST
time. O
I O
at O
least O
thought O
I'd O
be O
able O
to O
stand O
it. O
But, O
I O
was O
wrong. O
First, O
the O
weird O
looping? O
It O
was O
like O
watching O
"America's O
Funniest O
Home O
Videos". O
The O
damn O
parents. O
I O
hated O
them O
so O
much. O
The O
stereo-typical O
Latino O
family? B-FRANCHISE
I O
need O
to O
speak O
with O
the O
person O
responsible O
for O
this. O
We O
need O
to O
have O
a O
talk. O
That O
little O
girl O
who O
was O
always O
hanging O
on O
someone? O
I O
just O
hated O
her O
and O
had O
to O
mention O
it. O
Now, O
the O
final O
scene O
transcends, O
I O
must O
say. O
It's O
so O
gloriously O
bad O
and O
full O
of O
badness O
that O
it O
is O
a O
movie O
of O
its O
own. O
What O
crappy O
dancing. O
Horrible O
and O
beautiful O
at O
once. O

'War B-GENRE
movie' O
is O
a O
Hollywood O
genre O
that O
has O
been O
done O
and O
redone O
so O
many O

that O
clichéd O
dialogue, O
rehashed O
plot B-CLICHES
and O
over-the-top B-REMAKES
action B-GENRE

seem O
unavoidable O
for O
any O
conflict B-STORY
dealing O
with O
large-scale O
combat. O
Once O
in O
a O
while, O
however, O
a O
war B-GENRE
movie O
comes O
along O
that O
goes O
against O
the O

brings O
a O
truly O
original O
and O
compelling O
story B-STORY

again, O
calling O

a O

not O
entirely O
accurate. O
True O
enough, O
the O
film O
opens O
with O
a O
(quite O
literally) O
quick-and-dirty O
battle O
sequence O
that O
puts O
"Glory" O
director B-DIRECTION
Edward O

However, O
"Cold O

is O
not O
so O
much O
about O
the O

as O
it O
is O
about O
the O
period B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS

The O
story B-STORY
centers O
around O
disgruntled O
Confederate O

played O
by O
Jude O

who O
becomes O
disgusted O
with O

At O

this O

appears O
formulaic B-CLICHES

the O
romantic B-FRANCHISE

tribulations O
on O

Indeed, O
the O

One O
of O
the O
most O
significant O
quotes O
from O

pronounced O
halfway O

Girolamo, O
a O
physically O
non-descript, O

When O
we're O

him O
at O

this O
pivotal O

missing O
from O
his O
usual O
suitcase O
full O
of O
tightly O
stacked O
banknotes. O
At O
the O
news, O
he O
quietly O
but O
icily O
threatens O
his O
coaxing O
bank O
manager O
of O
wanting O
to O
close O
down O
his O
account. O
Meanwhile O
he O
tells O
us, O
the O
spectators, O
that O
when O
you O
bluff, O
you O
have O
to O
bluff O
right O
through O

then O
halfway O
through, O
tell O
the O

of O
Titta O

troubles. O

At O
one O
point O

Titta O

to O
feel O

"ridiculous". B-TONE
The O
first O
half O
of O
the O

may O
be O

some. O
It O

indeed O

Di O

days O

nights O
in O
that O
hotel O

an O
oddly O

scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY

this O
masterfully O

innovative O

The O

Another O

element O
was O
the O
way O

I O
bought O
this O
film O
at O
Blockbuster O
for O
$3.00, O
because O
it O
sounded O
interesting O
(a O
bit O
Ranma-esque, O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
someone O
dragging O
around O
a O
skeleton), O
because O
there O
was O
a O
cute O
girl O
in O
a O
mini-skirt O
on O
the O
back, O
and O
because O
there O
was O
a O
Restricted O
Viewing O
sticker O
on O
it. O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
a O
sweet O
or O
at O
least O
sincere O
coming O
of O
age O
story B-STORY
with O
a O
weird O
indie O
edge. O
I O
was O
100% O
wrong.<br O
/><br O
/>Having O
watched O
it, O
I O
have O
to O
wonder O
how O
it O
got O
the O
restricted O
sticker, O
since O
there O
is O
hardly O
any O
foul O
language, O
little O
violence, B-GENRE
and O
the O
closest O
thing O
to O
nudity O
(Honestly! O
I O
don't O
usually O
go O
around O
hoping O
for O
it!) O
is O
when O
the O
girl O
is O
in O
her O
nightgown O
and O
you O
see O
her O
panties O
(you O
see O
her O
panties O
a O
lot O
in O
this O
movie, O
because O
no O
matter O
what, O
she's O
wearing O
a O
miniskirt O
of O
some O
sort). O
Even O
the O
anti-religious O
humor O
is O
tame O
(and O
lame, O
caricatured, O
insincere, O
derivative, O
unoriginal, B-REMAKES
and O
worst O
of O
all O
not O
funny B-HUMOR
in O
the O
slightest--it O
would O
be O
better O
just O
to O
listen O
to O
Ray O
Stevens' O
"Would O
Jesus O
Wear O
a O
Rolex O
on O
His O
Television O
Show"). O
This O
would O
barely O
qualify O
as O
PG-13 O
(it O
is O
Not O
Rated), O
but O
Blockbuster O
refuses O
to O
let O
anyone O
under O
the O
age O
of O
17 O
rent O
this--as O
if O
it O
was O
pornographic. O
Any O
little O
kid O
could O
go O
in O
there O
and O
rent O
the O
edited O
version O
of O
Requiem O
for O
a O
Dream, O
but O
they O
insist O
that O
Zack O
and O
Reba O
is O
worse.<br O
/><br O
/>It O
is, O
but O
not O
in O
that O
way.<br O
/><br O
/>In O
a O
way, O
this O
worries O
me--the O
only O
thing O
left O
that O
could O
offend O
people O
is O
the O
idea O
of O
the O
suicide O
at O
the O
beginning. O
If O
anybody O
needs O
to O
see O
movies O
with O
honestly O
portrayed O
suicides O
(not O
this O
one, O
but O
better O
ones O
like O
The O
Virgin O
Suicides), O
it's O
teenagers. O
If O
both O
of O
those O
movies O
were O
rated O
R O
purely O
because O
of O
the O
suicide O
aspect, O
then O
I O
have O
little O
chance O
of O
turning O
a O
story B-STORY
I've O
been O
writing B-STORY
into O
a O
PG-13 O
movie O
(the O
main O
characters B-CAST
are O
eleven O
and O
a O
half O
and O
twelve). O
Suicide O
is O
one O
of O
the O
top O
three O
leading O
causes O
of O
death O
in O
teenagers O
(I O
think O
it's O
number O
2), O
so O
chances O
are O
that O
most O
teens O
have O
been O
or O
will O
be O
affected O
by O
it.<br O
/><br O
/>Just O
say O
no O
to O
this O
movie, O
though. O
2/10. O

The O
plot B-CLICHES
is O
about O
the O
death O
of O
little O
children. O
Hopper O
is O
the O
one O
who O
has O
to O
investigate O
the O
killings. O
During O
the O
movie O
it O
appears O
that O
he O
has O
some O
troubles O
with O
his O
daughter. O
In O
the O
end O
the O
serial O
killer O
get O
caught. O
That's O
it. O
But O
before O
you O
find O
out O
who O
dunnit, O
you O
have O
to O
see O
some O
terrible O
acting B-CAST
by O
all O
of O
the O
actors. O
It O
is O
unbelievable O
how O
bad O
these O
actors O
are, O
including O
Hopper. O
I O
could O
go O
on O
like O
this O
but O
that O
to O
much O
of O
a O
waste O
of O
my O
time. O
Just O
don't O
watch O
the O
movie. O
I've O
warned O
you. O

Ever O
watched O
a O
movie O
that O
lost O
the O
plot? B-CLICHES
Well, O
this O
didn't O
even O
really O
have O
one O
to O
begin O
with.<br O
/><br O
/>Where O
to O
begin? O
The O
achingly O
tedious O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
of O
our O
heroine O
sitting O
around O
the O
house O
with O
actually O
no O
sense O
of O
menace O
or O
even O
foreboding B-TONE
created O
even O
during O
the O
apparently O
constant B-MUSIC
thunderstorms O
(that O
are O
strangely O
never O
actually O
heard O
in O
the O
house-great O
double O
glazing)? O
The O
house O
that O
is O
apparently O
only O
a O
few O
miles O
from O
a O
town O
yet O
is O
several O
hours O
walk O
away(?) O
or O
the O
third O
girl O
who O
serves O
no O
purpose O
to O
the O
plot B-CLICHES
except O
to O
provide O
a O
surprisingly O
quick O
gory O
murder B-GENRE
just O
as O
the O
tedium O
becomes O
unbearable? O
Or O
even O
the O
beginning O
which O
suggests O
a O
spate O
of O
20+ O
killings O
throughout O
the O
area O
even O
though O
it O
is O
apparent O
the O
killer O
never O
ventures O
far O
from O
the O
house? O
Or O
the O
bizarre O
ritual O
with O
the O
salt O
& O
pepper O
that O
pretty O
much O
sums O
up O
most O
of O
the O
films O
inherent O
lack O
of O
direction.<br O
/><br O
/>Add O
a O
lead O
actress B-CAST
who O
can't O
act O
but O
at O
least O
is O
willing O
to O
do O
some O
completely O
irrelevant O
nude O
shower O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
and O
this O
video O
is O
truly O
nasty, O
but O
not O
in O
the O
way O
you O
hope.<br O
/><br O
/>Given O
a O
following O
simply O
for O
being O
banned O
in O
the O
UK O
in O
the O
80's O
(mostly O
because O
of O
a O
final O
surprisingly O
over O
extended O
murder) B-GENRE
it O
offers O
nothing O
but O
curiosity O
value- O
and O
one O
classic B-GENRE
'daft' O
murder B-GENRE
(don't O
worry-its O
telegraphed O
at O
least O
ten O
minutes O
before).<br O
/><br O
/>After O
a O
walk O
in O
the O
woods O
our O
victim O
comes O
to O
a O
rather O
steep O
upward O
slope O
which O
they O
obviously O
struggle B-STORY
up. O
Halfway O
through O
they O
see O
a O
figure O
at O
the O
top O
dressed O
in O
black B-HUMOR
and O
brandishing O
a O
large O
scythe. O
What O
do O
they O
do? O
Slide O
down O
and O
run O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
us? O
No, O
of O
course O
not- O
they O
struggle B-STORY
to O
the O
top O
and O
stand O
conveniently O
nice O
and O
upright O
in O
front O
of O
the O
murder B-GENRE
weapon.<br O

really O
IS O
only O
a O
movie O
as O
they O
say.. O

Okay, O
so O
this O
series B-FRANCHISE
kind O
of O
takes O
the O
route O

'here O

David O

helps O
out O
his O
ride O
who O
is O
in O
a O
bit O
of O
a O

- O
but O
what's O
wrong O
with O
that!? O
David O
Morse O
is O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
character O
actors O
out O
there, O
and O
certainly O
the O
coolest, O
and O
to O
have O
him O
in O
a O
series B-FRANCHISE
created O
by O
David O
Koepp O
- O
a O
great O
writer O
- O
is O
heaven!!<br O
/><br O
/>Due O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
love O
for O
this O
show O
by O
many, O
I O
can't O
see O
it O
going O
to O
a O
season O
series B-FRANCHISE
- O
but O
you O
never O
know? O
The O
amount O
of O
rubbish O
that O
has O
made O
it O
beyond O
that O
baffles O
me O
- O
let's O
hope O
something O
good B-CAST
can O
make O
it O
past O
a O
first O
series!!! B-FRANCHISE

After O
sitting O
through O
this O
pile O
of O
dung, O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
wondered O
whether O
it O
was O
actually O
the O
product O
of O
an O
experiment O
to O
see O
whether O
a O
computer O
program O
could O
produce O
a O
movie. O
It O
was O
that O
listless O
and O
formulaic. B-CLICHES
But O
the O
U.S. O
propaganda B-STORY
thrown O
in O
your O
face O
throughout O
the O
film O
proves--disappointingly--that O
it's O
the O
work O
of O
humans. O
Call O
me O
a O
conspiracy B-STORY
theorist, O
but O
quotes O
like, O
"We O
have O
to O
steal O
the O
Declaration O
of O
Independence O
to O
protect O
it" O
seem O
like O
ways O
to O
justify O
actions O
like O
the O
invasion O
of O
Iraq, O
etc. O
The O
fact O
that O
Nicholas O
Cage O
spews O
lines O
like, O
"I O
would O
never O
use O
the O
Declaration O
of O
Independence O
as O
a O
bargaining O
chip" O
with O
a O
straight O
face O
made O
me O
and O
my O
husband O
wonder O
whether O
the O
entire O
cast B-CAST
took O
Valium O
before O
shooting O
each O
scene. O
The O
"reasoning" O
behind O
each O
plot B-CLICHES
turn O
and O
new O
"clue" O
is O
truly O
ridiculous B-TONE
and O
impossible O
to O
follow. O
And O
there's O
also O
a O
bonus O
side O
plot B-CLICHES
of O
misogyny, O
with O
Dr. O
Whatever-Her-Name-Was O
being O
chided O
by O
all O
involved O
for O
"never O
shutting O
up." O
She's O
clearly O
in O
the O
movie O
only O
for O
looks, O
but O
they O
felt O
the O
need O
to O
slap O
a O
"Dr." O
title O
on O
her O
character O
to O
give O
her O
some O
gravity. O
At O
one O
point, O
Cage's O
character O
says, O
"Don't O
you O
ever O
shut O
up?" O
and O
the O
camera B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
pans O
to O
her O
looking O
poutily O
down O
at O
her O
hands, O
like O
she's O
a O
child. O
Truly O
grotesque. B-TONE
The O
only O
benefit O
to O
this O
movie O
was O
that O
it's O
so O
astonishingly O
bad, O
you O
do O
get O
a O
few O
laughs O
out O
of O
it. O
The O
really O
scary O
thing O
is O
that O
a O
majority O
of O
the O
people O
watching O
the O
movie O
with O
us O
seemed O
to O
enjoy O
it. O
Creepy.... O

It O
had O
all O
the O
clichés O
of O
movies O
of O
this O
type O
and O
no O
substance. O
The O
plot B-CLICHES
went O
nowhere O
and O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
movie O
I O
felt O
like O
a O
sucker O
for O
watching O
it. O
The O
production O
was O
good; B-CAST
however, O
the O
script B-STORY
and O
acting B-CAST
were O
B-movie O
quality. O
The O
casting O
was O
poor O
because O
there O
were O
good B-CAST
actors O
mixed O
in O
with O
crumby O
actors. O
The O
good B-CAST
actors O
didn't O
hold O
their O
own O
nor O
did O
they O
lift O
up O
the O
others. O
<br O
/><br O
/>This O
movie O
is O
not O
worthy O
of O
more O
words, O
but O
I O
will O
say O
more O
to O
meet O
the O
minimum O
requirement O
of O
ten O
lines. O
James O
Wood O
and O
Cuba O
Gooding, O
Jr. O
play O
caricatures O
of O
themselves O
in O
other O
movies. O
<br O
/><br O
/>If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
mindless B-TONE
entertainment, O
I O
still O
wouldn't O
recommend O
this O
movie. O

This O
movie O
is O
based O
on O
the O
book, O
"A O
Many O
Splendored O

by O
Han O
Suyin O

tackles O
issues O
of O
race O

between O

that O
comes O
from O
Han's O
personal O
experiences O
as O

Eurasian O
growing O
up O
in O
China. O
That O
background, O
and O
the O
beautiful O

gives O
this O

story B-STORY
a O
unique O

rather O
daring O
atmosphere O
for O
its O
time.<br O
/><br O

than O
that, O
the O
story B-STORY
is O
a O
stereotypical O

with O
a O
memorable B-MUSIC
song O
that O
is O
perhaps O
more O
remembered O
than O
the O
movie O
itself. O
The O
beautiful O
Jennifer O
Jones O
looks O
the O

gives O
a O
wonderful, O

made O
me O
cry O
out O
in O
pain. O
"How O
could O
ANYONE O
come O
up O
with O
something O
so O
crappy"? O
Gary O
Busey O
is O
know O
for O
his O
"B" O
movies, O
but O
this O
is O
a O
sure O
"W" O
movie. O
(W=waste).<br O
/><br O
/>Take O
for O
example: O
about O
two O
dozen O
FBI O
& O
local O
law O
officers O
surround O
a O
trailer O
house O
with O
a O
jeep O
wagoneer. O
Inside O
the O
jeep O
is O
MA O
and O
is O
"confused" O
as O
to O
why O
all O
the O
cops O
are O
about. O
Within O
seconds O
a O
huge O
gun O
battle O
ensues, O
MA O
being O
killed O
straight O
off. O
The O
cops O
blast O
away O
at O
the O
jeep O
with O
gary O
and O
company O
blasting O
away O
at O
them. O
The O
cops O
fall O
like O
dominoes O
and O
the O
jeep O
with O
Gary O
drives O
around O
in O
circles O
and O
are O
not O
hit O
by O
one O
single O
bullet/pellet. O
MA O
is O
killed O
and O
gary O
seems O
to O
not O
to O
have O
noticed-damn O
that O
guy O
is O
tough. O
Truly O
a O
miracle, O
not O
since O
the O
six-shooter O
held O
300 O
bullets O
has O
there O
been O
such O
a O
miracle. O

I O
had O
heard O
good B-CAST
things O
about O
"States O
of O
Grace" O
and O
came O
in O
with O
an O
open O
mind. O
I O
thought O
that O
"God's O
Army" O
was O
okay, O
and O
I O
thought O
that O
maybe O
Dutcher O
had O
improved O
and O
matured O
as O
a O
filmmaker. O
The O
film O
began O
with O
some O
shaky O
acting, B-CAST
and O
I O
thought, O
"well, O
maybe O
it O
will O
get O
better." O
Unfortunately, O
it O
never O
did. O
The O
picture O
starts O
out O
by O
introducing O
two O
elders O
-- O
Mormon O
missionaries O
-- O
and O
it O
seems O
that O
the O
audience O
will O
get O
to O
know O
them O
and O
grow O
to O
care O
about O
them. O
Instead, O
the O
story B-STORY
degenerates O
into O
a O
highly O
improbable O
series B-FRANCHISE
of O
unfortunate O
events O
highlighting O
blatant O
disobedience O
by O
the O
missionaries O
(something O
that O
undeniably O
exists, O
but O
rarely O
on O
the O
level O
that O
Dutcher O
portrays) O
and O
it O
becomes O
almost O
laughable.<br O
/><br O
/>Dutcher's O
only O
success O
in O
this O
movie O
is O
his O
successful O
alienation O
of O
his O
target O
audience. O
By O
unrealistically O
and O
inaccurately O
portraying O
the O
lives O
of O
Mormon O
missionaries, O
Dutcher O
accomplishes O
nothing O
more O
than O
angering O
his O
predominantly O
Mormon O
audience. O
The O
film O
in O
no O
way O
reflects O
reality. O
Missions O
are O
nothing O
like O
what O
Dutcher O
shows O
(having O
served O
a O
Mormon O
mission O
myself O
I O
can O
attest O
to O
this O
fact) O
and O
gang O
life O
in O
California O
certainly O
contains O
much O
more O
explicit O
language O
than O
the O
occasional O
mild O
vulgarity.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
conclusion, O
which O
I'm O
assuming O
was O
supposed O
to O
touch O
the O
audience O
and O
inspire O
them O
to O
believe O
that O
forgiveness O
is O
available O
to O
all, O
was O
both O
unbelievable O
(c'mon, O
the O
entire O
mission O
gathers O
to O
see O
this O
elder O
sent O
home O
-- O
and O
the O
mom O
and O
the O
girl O
are O
standing O
right O
next O
to O
each O
other!) O
and O
cheesy. B-HUMOR
Next O
time, O
Dutcher, O
try O
making O
a O
movie O
that O
SOMEONE O
can O
identify O
with. O

This O
movie O
struck O
home O
for O
me. O
Being O
29, O
I O
remember O
the O
'80's O
and O
my O
father O
working O
in O
a O
factory. O
I O
figured, O
if O
I O
worked O
hard O
too, O
if O
I O
had O
pride O
and O
never O
gave O
up O
I O
too O
could O
have O
the O
American O
Dream, O
the O
house, O
a O
few O
kids, O
a O
car O
all O
to O
call O
my O
own. O
I've O
noted O
however, O
without O
a O
degree O
in O
something O
(unlike O
my O
father O
that O
quit O
at O
ninth O
grade) O
and O
a O
keen O
sense O
of O
greed O
and O
laziness, O
you O
can't O
get O
anywhere.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
would O
like O
to O
know O
if O
anyone O
has O
this O
movie O
on O
DVD O
or O
VHS. O
it's O
made O
for O
TV, O
and O
I O
just O
saw O
it O
an O
hour O
ago. O
Ic O
an't O
find O
it O
anywhere! O
I'd O
love O
to O
show O
this O
to O
my O
friends, O
my O
pseudo O
friends, O
family B-FRANCHISE
and O
other O
relatives, O
see O
what O
they O
think O
and O
remind O
them O
that O
once O
upon O
a O
time, O
Americans O
WOULD O
work O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
feeling O
honor O
and O
that O
we O
had O
pride O
in O
what O
we O
accomplished!! O
I O
think O
the O
feeling O
is O
still O
there, O
but O
in O
a O
heavy O
downward O
spiral O
with O
so O
many O
things O
being O
made O
overseas... O

As O
a O
disclaimer, O
I've O
seen O
the O
movie O
5-6 O
times O
in O
the O
last O
15 O
years, O
and O
I O
only O
just O
saw O
the O
musical B-REMAKES
this O
week. O
This O
allowed O
me O
to O
judge O
the O
movie O
without O
being O
tainted O
by O
what O
was O
or O
wasn't O
in O
the O
musical B-REMAKES
(however, O
it O
tainted O
me O
when O
I O
watched O
the O
musical B-REMAKES
:) O
) O
<br O
/><br O
/>I O
actually O
believe O
Michael O
Douglas O
worked O
quite O
well O
in O
that O
role, O
along O
with O
Kasey. O
I O
think O
her O
'Let O
me O
dance O
for O
you O
scene' O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
parts O
of O
the O
movie, O
a O
worthwhile O
addition O
compared O
to O
the O
musical. B-REMAKES
The O
dancers O
and O
singing O
in O
the O
movie O
are O
much O
superior O
to O
the O
musical, B-REMAKES
as O
well O
as O
the O
cast B-CAST
which O
is O
at O
least O
10 O
times O
bigger O
(easier O
to O
do O
in O
the O
movie O
of O
course). O
The O
decors, O
lighting, B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
dancing, O
and O
singing O
are O
also O
much O
superior O
in O
the O
movie, O
which O
should O
be O
expected, O
and O
was O
indeed O
delivered. O
<br O
/><br O
/>The O
songs B-MUSIC
that O
were O
in O
common O
with O
the O
musical B-REMAKES
are O
better O
done O
in O
the O
movie, O
the O
new O
ones O
are O
quite O
good B-CAST
ones, O
and O
the O
whole O
movie O
just O
delivers O
more O
than O
the O
musical B-REMAKES
in O
my O
opinion, O
especially O
compared O
to O
a O
musical B-REMAKES
which O
has O
few O
decors. O
The O
one O
bad O
point O
on O
the O
movie O
is O
the O
obvious O
cuts O
between O
the O
actors O
talking, O
and O
dubbed O
singers O
during O
the O
singing O
portions O
for O
some O
of O
the O
characters, B-CAST
but O
their O
dancing O
is O
impeccable, O
and O
the O
end O
product O
was O
more O
enjoyable O
than O
the O
musical B-REMAKES

Protocol O
is O
an O
implausible B-TONE
movie O
whose O
only O
saving O
grace O
is O
that O
it O
stars O
Goldie O
Hawn O
along O
with O
a O
good B-CAST
cast B-CAST
of O
supporting O
actors. O
The O
story B-STORY
revolves O
around O
a O
ditzy O
cocktail O
waitress O
who O
becomes O
famous O
after O
inadvertently O
saving O
the O
life O
of O
an O
Arab O
dignitary. O
The O
story B-STORY
goes O
downhill O
halfway O
through O
the O
movie O
and O
Goldie's O
charm O
just O
doesn't O
save O
this O
movie. O
Unless O
you O
are O
a O
Goldie O
Hawn O
fan O
don't O
go O
out O
of O
your O
way O
to O
see O
this O
film. O

How O
this O
film O
could O
be O
classified O
as O
Drama, B-GENRE
I O
have O
no O
idea. O
If O
I O
were O
John O
Voight O
and O
Mary O
Steenburgen, O
I O
would O
be O
trying O
to O
erase O
this O
from O
my O
CV. O
It O
was O
as O
historically O
accurate O
as O
Xena O
and O
Hercules. O
Abraham O
and O
Moses O
got O
melded O
into O
Noah. O
Lot, O
Abraham's O
nephew, O
Lot, O
turns O
up O
thousands O
of O
years O
before O
he O
would O
have O
been O
born. O
Canaanites O
wandered O
the O
earth...really? O
What O
were O
the O
scriptwriters O
thinking? O
Was O
it O
just O
ignorance O
("I O
remember O
something O
about O
Noah O
and O
animals, O
and O
Lot O
and O
Canaanites O
and O
all O
that O
stuff O
from O
Sunday O
School") O
or O
were O
they O
trying O
to O
offend O
the O
maximum O
number O
of O
people O
on O
the O
planet O
as O
possible- O
from O
Christians, O
Jews O
and O
Muslims, O
to O
historians, O
archaeologists, O
geologists, O
psychologists, O
linguists O
...as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact, O
did O
anyone O
not O
get O
offended? O
Anyone O
who O
had O
even O
a O
modicum O
of O
taste O
would O
have O
winced O
at O
this O
one! O

THE O
POWER O
AND O
THE O
GLORY O
was O
unseen O
by O
the O
public O
for O
nearly O
twenty O
or O
thirty O
years O
until O
the O
late O
1990s O
when O
it O
resurfaced O
and O
even O
showed O
up O
on O
television. O
In O
the O
meantime O
it O
had O
gained O
in O
notoriety O
because O
Pauline O
Kael's O
THE O
CITIZEN O
KANE O
BOOK O
had O
suggested O
that O
the O
Herman O
Mankiewicz O
- O
Orson O
Welles O
screenplay O
for O
KANE O
was O
based O
on O
Sturgis' O
screenplay O
here. O
As O
is O
mentioned O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
this O
thread O
for O
the O
film O
on O
the O
IMDb O
web O
site, O
Kael O
overstated O
her O
case.<br O
/><br O
/>There O
are O
about O
six O
narrators O
who O
take O
turns O
dealing O
with O
the O
life O
of O
Charles O
Foster O
Kane: O
the O
newsreel O
(representing O
Ralston O
- O
the O
Henry O
Luce O
clone), O
Thatcher's O
memoirs, O
Bernstein, O
Jed O
Leland, O
Susan O
Alexander O
Kane, O
and O
Raymond O
the O
butler. O
Each O
has O
his O
or O
her O
different O
slant O
on O
Kane, O
reflecting O
their O
faith O
or O
disappointment O
or O
hatred O
of O
the O
man. O
And O
of O
course O
each O
also O
reveals O
his O
or O
her O
own O
failings O
when O
they O
are O
telling O
their O
version O
of O
Kane's O
story. B-STORY
This O
method B-PERFORMANCE
also O
leads O
to O
frequent O
overlapping O
re-tellings O
of O
the O
same O
incident.<br O
/><br O
/>This O
is O
not O
the O
situation O
in O
THE O
POWER O
AND O
THE O
GLORY. O
Yes, O
like O
KANE O
it O
is O
about O
a O
legendary O
business O
leader O
- O
here O
it O
is O
Tom O
Garner O
(Spencer O
Tracy), O
a O
man O
who O
rose O
from O
the O
bottom O
to O
being O
head O
of O
the O
most O
successful O
railroad O
system O
in O
the O
country. B-MUSIC
But O
there O
are O
only O
two O
narrators O
- O
they O
are O
Garner's O
right O
hand O
man O
Henry O
(Ralph O
Morgan) O
and O
his O
wife O
(Sarah O
Padden). O
This O
restricts O
the O
nearly O
three O
dimensional O
view O
we O
get O
at O
times O
of O
Kane O
in O
Garner. O
Henry, O
when O
he O
narrates, O
is O
talking O
about O
his O
boss O
and O
friend, O
whom O
he O
respected O
and O
loved. O
His O
wife O
is O
like O
the O
voice O
of O
the O
skeptical O
public O
- O
she O
sees O
only O
the O
flaws O
in O
Henry.<br O
/><br O
/>Typical O
example: O
Although O
he O
worked O
his O
way O
up, O
Tom O
becomes O
more O
and O
more O
anti-labor O
in O
his O
later O
years. O
Unions O
are O
troublemakers, O
and O
he O
does O
not O
care O
to O
be O
slowed O
down O
by O
their O
shenanigans. O
Henry O
describes O
Tom's O
confrontation O
with O
the O
Union O
in O
a O
major O
walk-out, O
and O
how O
it O
preoccupied O
him O
to O
the O
detriment O
of O
his O
home O
life. O
But O
Henry's O
wife O
reminds O
him O
how O
Tom O
used O
scabs O
and O
violence B-GENRE
to O
end O
the O
strike O
(apparently O
blowing O
up O
the O
Union's O
headquarters O
- O
killing O
many O
people). O
So O
we O
have O
two O
views O
of O
the O
man O
but O
one O
is O
pure O
white O
and O
one O
is O
pure O
black.<br O
/><br O
/>I'm O
not O
really O
knocking O
THE O
POWER O
AND O
THE O
GLORY O
for O
not O
duplicating O
KANE's O
success O
(few O
films O
do O
- O
including O
all O
of O
Orson O
Welles' O
other O
films), O
but O
I O
am O
aware O
that O
the O
story B-STORY
is O
presented O
well O
enough O
to O
hold O
one's O
interest O
to O
the O
end. O
And O
thanks O
to O
the O
performances O
of O
Tracy O
and O
Colleen O
Moore O
as O
his O
wife O
Sally, O
the O
tragedy O
of O
the O
worldly O
success O
of O
the O
pair O
is O
fully O
brought O
home.<br O
/><br O
/>When O
they O
marry, O
Tom O
wants O
to O
do O
well O
(in O
part) O
to O
give O
his O
wife O
and O
their O
family B-FRANCHISE
the O
benefits O
he O
never O
had. O
But O
in O
America O
great O
business O
success O
comes O
at O

all, O
I O

it O

requires O
actors O
of O
the O
highest O
caliber O
to O
bring O
it O
to O
life. O
Finney, O
only O
47 O
years O
old, O
is O
completely O
believable B-PERFORMANCE
as O
a O
very O
old, O
very O
sick, O
petulant, O
bullying, O
but O
brilliant O
stage O
actor. B-CAST
He O
hisses O
and O
fumes O
at O
his O
fellow O
actors O
even O
when O
they're O
taking O
their O
bows! O
And O
Courtenay O
is O
no O
less O
convincing B-PERFORMANCE
as O
the O
mincing O
dresser, O
who O
must O
sometimes O
act O
more O
as O
a O
mother O
than O
as O
a O
valet O
to O
his O
elderly O
employer. O
Employer O
is O
really O
the O
wrong O
term O
to O
use, O
though. O
For O
although, O
technically O
their O
relationship O
is O
that O
of O
employer O
and O
employee, O
most O
of O
the O
time O
Sir O
and O
Norman O
act O
like O
nothing O
so O
much O
as O
an O
old O
married O
couple.<br O
/><br O
/>Yes, O
there O
are O
others O
in O
the O
cast B-CAST
of O
this O
movie, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
question O
that O
the O
true O
stars O
are O
Finney, O
Courtenay, O
and O
the O
marvelous O
script B-STORY
by O
Ronald O
Harwood. O
That O
is O
not O
to O
say O
that O
there O
aren't O
other O
fine O
performances, O
most O
notably O
Eileen O
Atkins O
as O
the O
long-suffering O
stage O
manager O
Madge. O
There O
is O
a O
wonderful O
scene O
where O
Sir O
and O
Madge O
talk O
about O
old O
desires, O
old O
regrets, O
and O
what O
might O
have O
been.<br O
/><br O
/>Although O
it O
doesn't O
get O
talked O
about O
these O
days, O
it O
is O
worth O
remembering O
that O
The O
Dresser O
was O
nominated O
for O
five O
Academy O
Awards: O
Best O
Actor B-CAST
nominations O
for O
both O
Finney O
and O
Courtenay, O
Best O
Picture, O
Best O
Director B-DIRECTION
(Peter O
Yates), O
and O
Best O
Adapted O
Screenplay.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
had O
remembered O
this O
as O
being O
a O
good B-CAST
movie, O
but O
I O
wasn't O
prepared O
to O
be O
as O
completely O
mesmerized O
as O
I O
was O
from O
beginning O
to O
end. O
If O
you O
want O
to O
see O
an O
example O
of O
what O
great O
acting B-CAST
is O
all O
about, O
and O
be O
hugely O
entertained O
all O
the O
while, O
then O
I O
encourage O
you O
to O
see O
The O
Dresser. O

What O
happened? O
What O
we O
have O
here O
is O
basically O
a O
solid O
and O
plausible O
premise O
and O
with O
a O
decent O
and O
talented O
cast, B-CAST
but O
somewhere O
the O
movie O
loses O
it. O
Actually, O
it O
never O
really O
got O
going. O
There O
was O
a O
little O
excitement O
when O
we O
find O
out O
that O
Angie O
is O
not O
really O
pregnant, O
then O
find O
out O
that O
she O
is O
after O
all, O
but O
that O
was O
it. O
Steve O
Martin, O
who O
is O
a O
very O
talented O
person O
and O
usually O
brings O
a O
lot O
to O
a O
movie, O
was O
dreadful O
and O
his O
entire O
character O
was O
not O
even O
close O
to O
being O
important O
to O
this O
movie, O
other O
than O
to O
make O
it O
longer. O
I O
really O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
see O
more O
interactions O
between O
the O
main O
characters, B-CAST
Kate O
and O
Angie, O
and O
maybe O
try O
not O
for O
a O
pure O
comedy, B-GENRE
which O
unfortunately O
it O
was O
not, O
but O
maybe O
a O
drama B-GENRE
with O
comedic B-TONE
elements. O
I O
think O
if O
the O
movie O
did O
this O
it O
could O
have O
been O
very O
funny B-HUMOR
since O
both O
actresses O
are O
quite O
funny B-HUMOR
in O
their O
own O
ways O
and O
sitting O
here O
I O
can O
think O
of O
numerous O
scenarios O
that O
would O
have O
been O
a O
riot. O

I've O
just O
watched O
Fingersmith, O
and O
I'm O
stunned O
to O
see O
the O
8/10 O
average B-PERFORMANCE
rating O
for O
the O
show.<br O
/><br O
/>Not O
only O
was O
the O
plot B-CLICHES
was O
difficult O
to O
follow, O
but O
it O
seems O
character O
development O
was O
randomly O
applied.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
actors O
were O
adequate, O
but O
in O
the O
process O
of O
attempting O
to O
create O
twists B-STORY
and O
turns, O
their O
characters B-CAST
are O
rendered O
entirely O
one O
dimensional. O
Once O
this O
happens, O
the O
story B-STORY
really O
falls O
flat O
and O
becomes O
tedious.<br O
/><br O
/>And O
just O
in O
case O
anyone O
didn't O
see O
the O
predictable B-CLICHES
lesbian O
undertones O
from O
miles O
way, O
this O
is O
hammered O
home O
in O
the O
most O
banal O
terms O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
film.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
end O
scene O
is O
disappointing O
and O
phoned O
in, O
and O
anyone O
who O
sat O
back O
and O
went O
"Ohhh, O
so O
they O
were O
carpet O
munchers O
all O
along!", O
must O
have O
been O
out O
for O
the O
evening.<br O

least O
a O
bit O
raunchy, B-TONE

it... O

So O
let's O
begin!)))<br O

movie O
itself O
is O
as O
original O
as O
Cronenberg's O
movies O
would O
usually O
appear...<br O
/><br O
/>My O
intention O
to O
see O
it O
was O
certainly O
JJL O
being O
one O
of O
my O
favourite O
actresses. O
She O
is O
as O
lovely O
as O
usual, O
this O
cutie!<br O
/><br O
/>I O
would O
not O
say O
it O
was O
my O
favourite O
movie O
of O
hers. O
Still O
it's O
quite O
interesting O
and O
entertaining O
to O
follow. O
<br O
/><br O
/>The O
rest O
of O
the O
cast B-CAST
is O
not O
extremely O
impressive B-PERFORMANCE
but O
it O
is O
not O
some O
kind O
of O
a O
miscast O
star O
array. O
;)<br O
/><br O
/>Recommend O
with O
confidence!)))) O

Besides O
being O
boring, B-TONE
the O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
were O
oppressive B-TONE
and O
dark. B-HUMOR
The O
movie O
tried O
to O
portray O
some O
kind O
of O
moral, O
but O
fell O
flat O
with O
its O
message. O
What O
were O
the O
redeeming O
qualities?? O
On O
top O
of O
that, O
I O
don't O
think O
it O
could O
make O
librarians O
look O
any O
more O
unglamorous O
than O
it O
did. O

An O
unmarried O
woman O
named O
Stella O
(Bette O
Midler) O
gets O
pregnant O
by O
a O
wealthy O
man O
(Stephen O
Collins). O
He O
offers O
to O
marry O
her O
out O
of O
a O
sense O
of O
obligation O
but O
she O
turns O
him O
down O
flat O
and O
decides O
to O
raise O
the O
kid O
on O
her O
own. O
Things O
go O
OK O
until O
the O
child O
named O
Jenny O
(Trini O
Alvarado) O
becomes O
a O
teenager O
and O
things O
gradually O
(and O
predictably) O
become O
worse.<br O
/><br O
/>I've O
seen O
both O
the O
silent B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
version O
and O
sound O
version O
of O
"Stella O
Dallas". O
Neither O
one O
affected O
me O
much O
(and O
I O
cry O
easily) O
but O
they O
were O
well-made O
if O
dated. B-CLICHES
Trying O
to O
remake B-REMAKES
this O
in O
1990 O
was O
just O
a O
stupid O
idea. O
I O
guess O
Midler O
had O
enough O
power O
after O
the O
incomprehensible O
success O
of O
"Beaches" O
to O
get O
this O
made. O
This O
(predictably) O
bombed. O
The O
story B-STORY
is O
laughable O
and O
dated B-CLICHES
by O
today's O
standards. O
Even O
though O
Midler O
and O
Alvarado O
give O
good B-CAST
performances O
this O
film O
really O
drags O
and O
I O
was O
bored O
silly O
by O
the O
end. O
Stephen O
Collins O
and O
Marsha O
Mason O
(both O
good B-CAST
actors) O
don't O
help O
in O
supporting O
roles. O
Flimsy O
and O
dull. B-TONE
Really--who O
thought O
this O
would O
work? O
See O

All O
of O
these O

Although O
it O
does O
contain O
elements O
of O
both O
- O

is O
more O
of O

nothing O

This O

particularly O
cringe-worthy; B-HUMOR
and O
the O
special B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
effects O
are O
bargain B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS

consisting O
of O
rubbery B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS

would O
have O
looked O
dated B-CLICHES
ten O
years O
earlier.<br O
/><br O
/>3/10 O
solely O
for O
the O
high O
bimbo O
quotient. O

I O
really O
like O
Salman O
Kahn O
so O
I O
was O
really O
disappointed O
when O
I O
seen O
this O
movie. O
It O
didn't O
have O
much O
of O
a O
plot B-CLICHES
and O
what O
they O
did O
have O
was O
not O
that O
appealing. O
Salman O
however O
did O
look O
good B-CAST
in O
the O
movie O
looked O
young O
and O
refreshed O
but O
was O
worth O
the O
price O
of O
this O
DVD. O
The O
music B-MUSIC
was O
not O
bad O
it O
was O
quite O
nice. O
Usually O
Indian O
movies O
are O
at O
least O
two O
to O
three O
hours O
long O
but O
this O
was O
a O
very O
short B-CAST
movie O
for O
an O
Indian O
film. O
The O
American O
actress B-CAST
that O
played O
in O
the O
movie O
is O
from O
the O
television O
hit O
series B-FRANCHISE
Heroes, O
Ali B-CAST
Larter. B-CAST
Her O
acting B-CAST
had O
a O
lot O
to O
be O
desired. O
However O
she O
did O
look O
good B-CAST
in O
the O
Indian O
dresses O
that O
she O
wore. O
All O
the O
movie O
had O
not O
a O
lot O
to O
be O
desired O
and O
I O
hope O
Salman O
does O
a O
lot O
better O
on O
his O
next O
movie. O
Thank O
you. O

I'm O
not O
sure O
why O
the O
producers O
needed O
to O
trade B-FRANCHISE
on O
the O
name O
of O
a O
somewhat O
successful O
movie O
franchise O
because O
the O
title O
suggests O
that O
it O
is O
a O
sequel B-FRANCHISE
to O
the O
first O
three O
movies..which O
it O
is O
not. O
Even O
though O
Marques O
Houston O
did O
appear O
in O
"HP3", O
he O
played O
a O
totally O
different O
character O
(he O
was, O
eight O
years O
older) O
in O
this O
film. O
Okay...so O
Reid O
and O
Martin O
weren't O
the O
most O
talented O
and O
couldn't O
carry O
a O
film O
all O
by O
themselves..but O
to O
trade B-FRANCHISE
on O
the O
HP O
franchise O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
there O
could O
have O
made O
some O
sort O
of O
reference O
(albeit O
minor) O
to O
the O
earlier O
movies. O
I'm O
sure O
everyone O
who O
wanted O
to O
see O
it O
was O
"hoodwinked"--into O
thinking O
that O
they O
were O
seeing O
a O
sequel--not O
a O
totally O
different O
film O
with O
a O
familiar O
name. O
And O
I'm O
sorry...Kym O
Whitley O
is O
not O
funny, B-HUMOR
and O
could O
not O
hold O
a O
candle O
to O
the O
late O
Robin O
Harris, O
Ketty O
Lester, O
or O
DC O
Curry O
in O
the O
earlier O
films. O
Although O
Meagen O
Good B-CAST
and O
Mari O
Morrow B-CAST
are O
a O
substantial O
visual B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
diversion...I O
have O
to O
give O
this O
a O
THUMBS O
DOWN!! O
Just O
naming O
the O
film O
"Down O
to O
the O
Last O
Minute" O
would O
have O
been O
OK. O
Furthermore, O
the O
Hudlin O
brothers O
(who O
produced O
the O
first O
three O
movies) O
were O
not O
involved O
in O
the O
making O
of O
this O
film. O

This O
film O
laboured O
along O
with O
some O
of O
the O
most O
predictable B-CLICHES
story B-STORY
lines O
and O
shallow O
characters B-CAST
ever O
seen. O
The O
writer O
obviously O
bought O
the O
playbook O
"How O
to O
write O
a O
space O
disaster O
movie" O
and O
followed O
it O
play O
by O
play. O
In O
particular, O
the O
stereo-typical O
use O
of O
astronauts O
talking O
to O
their O
loved O
ones O
from O
outer O
space O
- O
putting O
on O
a O
brave O
show O
in O
the O
face O
of O
disaster O
- O
has O
been O
done O
time O
and O
time O
again.<br O

Q O
appears O
to O
have O
been O
written O
in O
the O
hope O
that O
the O
producers O
would O
throw O
$50 O
million O
at O
the O
project. O
But, O
judging O
by O
the O
latter O
half O
of O
the O
film O
which O
contained O
numerous O
lame O
attempts O
at O
special B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
effects, O
the O
producers O
could O
only O
muster O
$50 O
thousand. O
To O
learn O
that O
the O
film O
was O
nominated O
for O
a O
"Special B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
Visual B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
Effects" O
Emmy O
has O
me O
absolutely O
gob-smacked.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
think O
a O
handful O
of O
high O
school O
students O
with O
a O
pass O
in O
Media O
Studies O
could O
have O
created O
more O
believable B-PERFORMANCE
effects!<br O
/><br O
/>And O
the O
plot B-CLICHES
holes B-STORY
are O
too O
numerous O
to O
mention. O
But O
I O
will O
pick O
one O
out O
as O
an O
example. O
Now, O
I'm O
no O
NASA O
expert, O
but O
surely O
it's O
highly O
implausible B-TONE
that O
a O
worker O
attached O
to O
the O
shuttle O
simulator O
would O
suddenly O
hold O
a O
position O
of O
power O
in O
the O
control O
room O
when O
things O
start O
to O
go O
pear-shaped O
with O
the O
program. O
Surely O
there O
is O
someone O
more O
experienced O
at O
Mission O
Control O
who O
the O
Program O
Director B-DIRECTION
would O
call O
on O
rather O
than O
a O
twenty-nine O
year O
old O
who O
has O
not O
been O
in O
the O
control O
room O
before.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
only O
saving O
grace O
for O
this O
film O
is O
the O
work O
of O
Bill O
Campbell. B-CAST
He O
manages O
to O
make O
a O
good B-CAST
attempt O
at O
salvaging O
something O
out O
of O
the O
train O
wreck O
that O
is O
this O
script.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
give O
this O
film O
2 O
out O
of O
10, O
with O
the O
above-average O
work O
of O
Bill O
Campbell B-CAST
in O
the O
lead O
role O
saving O
it O
from O
a O
lower O
mark. O

Caddyshack O
Two O
is O
a O
good B-CAST
movie O
by O
itself O
but O
compared O
to O
the O
original O
it O
cant O
stack B-CAST
up. O
Robert O
Stack B-CAST
is O
a O
horrible O
replacement O
for O
Ted O
Knight O
and O
Jackie O
Mason, O
while O
funny B-HUMOR
just O
cant O
compete O
with O
Rodney O
Dangerfield. O
Ty O
Webb O
is O
funny, B-HUMOR
being O
the O
only O
character O
from O
the O
original. O
Most O
of O
the O
other O
characters B-CAST
in O
the O
movie O
lack O
the O
punch O
of O
the O
original O
(Henry O
Wilcoxon O
for O
example) O
except O
for O
the O
hystericly O
funny B-HUMOR
lawyer O
Peter O
Blunt, O
being O
played O
by O
Randy O
Quaid. B-CAST
Every O
line O
he O
says O
reminds O
me O
of O
the O
originals O
humor, O
especially O
the O
scene O
at O
his O
office O
(I O
don't O
go O
in O
for O
law O
suits O
or O
motions. O
I O
find O
out O
where O
you O
live O
and O
come O
to O
your O
house O
and O
beat O
down O
your O
door O
with O
a O
f***ing O
baseball O
bat, O
make O
a O
bonfire O
with O
the O
chippindale,maybe O
roast O
that O
golden O
retriever O
(arff O
arff O
arff) O
then O
eat O
it. O
And O
then O
I'm O
comin' O
upstairs O
junior, O
and O
I'm O
grabbing O
you O
by O
your O
brooks O
brothers O
pjs, O
and O
cramming O
your O
brand O
new O
BMW O
up O
your O
tight O
a**! O
Do O
we O
have O
an O
understanding?). O
Offsetting O
his O
small O
role O
however, O
is O
Dan O
Acroyd, O
who O
is O
obviously O
no O
replacement O
for O
Bill O
Murray. O
His O
voice O
is O
beyond O
irritating O
and O
everything O
he O
does O
isnt O
even O
funny, B-HUMOR
its O
just O
stupid. O
Overall O
Caddyshack O
II O
is O
a O
good B-CAST
movie, O
but O
in O
comparison O
to O
the O
awesome O
original O
it O
just O
cant O
cut O
it. O

Honestly O
- O
this O
short B-CAST
film O
sucks. O
the O
dummy O
used O
in O
the O
necro O
scene O
is O
pretty O
well O
made O
but O
still O
phony O
enough O
looking O
to O
ruin O
the O
viewing O
experience. O
the O
Unearthed O
DVD O
is O
crisp O
and O
clear O
and O
I O
haven't O
made O
up O
my O
mind O
if O
this O
helps O
or O
hinders O
it. O
If O
the O
film O
was O
a O
little O
grainy B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
it O
might O
have O
added O
some O
"creepiness O
factor" O
to O
what O
was O
going O
on. O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
why O
this O
film O
has O
so O
much O
hype O
surrounding O
it O
other O
than O
the O
subject O
matter O
- O
but O
to O
be O
honest O
the O
necrophilia B-STORY
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
in O
films O
like O
NEKROMANTIK O
and O
VISITOR O
Q O
among O
others, O
are O
more O
shocking O
than O
in O
AFTERMATH. O
All O
this O
talk O
about O
the O
film O
being O
about O
loneliness O
and O
all O
other O
manner O
of O
deep O
philosophy O
is O
bull****. O
This O
is O
an O
expensive, O
beautifully O
filmed O
turd. O
It's O
not O
that O
shocking, O
it's O
not O
that O
disgusting. O
if O
you O
insist O
on O
viewing O
it O
- O
rent O
it. O
I O
give O
it O
a O
3 O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
not O
many O
people O
make O
explicit O
movies O
about O
necrophilia B-STORY
(there O
should O
definitely O
be O
a O
bigger O
selection O
for O
us O
sickos O
;) O
- O
the O
filming O
is O
good B-CAST
and O
it O
does O
have O
some O
"gore" B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
(if O
watching O
a O
rubbery B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
looking O
doll O
get O
cut O
open O
is O
considered O
gore...) B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
but O
other O
than O
that O
- O
absolutely O
nothing O
going O
for O
this O
over-hyped O
mess. O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
- O
GENESIS O
- O
Cerda's O
"sequel" B-FRANCHISE
to O
AFTERMATH O
(now O
available O
as O
a O
"double O
feature" O
released O
by O
Unearthed O
films) O
is O
an O
absolute O
masterpiece O
of O
a O
short B-CAST
film, O
really O
showing O
what O
a O
good B-CAST
director B-DIRECTION
Cerda O
really O
is O
when O
given O
the O
right O
material. O
Although O
I O
don't O
care O
for O
AFTERMATH O
at O
all, O
GENESIS O
is O
so O
well O
made O
that O
I O
will O
forgive O
Cerda O
and O
Definitely O
keep O
an O
eye O
out O
for O
him O
in O
the O
future... O

I O
thought O
that O
Mukhsin O
has O
been O
wonderfully O
written. O
Its O
not O
just O
about O
entertainment. O
There's O
tonnes O
of O
subtle O
messages O
that O
i O
think O
Yasmin O
was O
trying O
to O
bring O
across. O
And O
yes, O
it O
might O
be O
confusing O
to O
some O
of O
you(especially O
if O
you O
didn't O
watch O
Sepet O
and/or O
Gubra O
for O
76 O
times).<br O
/><br O
/>I O
bet O
u O
noticed O
how O
they O
use O
characters B-CAST
from O
the O
two O
movies O
before O
right? O
Its O
really O
ironic B-HUMOR
how O
the O
characters B-CAST
relate. O
Like O
the O
bossy O
neighbour O
is O
that O
prostitute O
from O
Gubra. O
And O
the O
chick O
at O
the O
snooker O
pad O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
the O
religious O
and O
wife O
of O
the O
pious O
man O
in O
the O
future. O
<br O
/><br O
/>And O
i O
absolutely O
love O
the O
voice-overs. O
Its O
crude O
yet O
awakeningly O
fresh. O
Like, O
when O
they O
took O
a O
shot O
of O
the O
Rumah O
Tumpangan O
Gamin O
signboard, O
then O
there O
was O
suddenly O
Mukhsin's O
voice O
saying O
'Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim..' O
(the O
scene O
when O
he O
climbed O
the O
tree).<br O
/><br O
/>It O
captured O
Malaysian's O
attitude(and O
in O
some O
mild O
way, O
sniggering O
at O
how O
pathetic O
it O
is) O
portrayed O
in O
the O
character. O
For O
example, O
even O
the O
kids O
can O
be O
really O
sharp O
tongued(complete O
with O
the O
shrill O
annoying O
voice) O
and O
simply O
bad O
mouth O
ppl O
all O
movie O
long. O
And O
how O
you O
can O
be O
such O
a O
busybody O
and O
talk O
about O
ppl, O
when O
ur O
own O
life O
isn't O
sorted O
out. O
<br O
/><br O
/>All O
i O
can O
say O
is, O
this O
movie O
totally O
reached O
my O
expectation O
if O
not O
exceeded O
it. O
<br O
/><br O
/>It O
kept O
me O
glued O
to O
the O
screen, O
i O
couldn't O
even O
take O
my O
eyes O
off O
it. O
Not O
even O
to O
make O
out O
in O
the O
cinema. O
Ha O
ha. O

I O
am O
not O
a O
golf O
fan O
by O
any O
means. O
On O
May O
26 O
about O
10:30 O
PM O
the O
movie O
started O
with O
a O
scene O
in O
the O
late O
1800's. O
Old O
movies O
I O
like O
but O
not O
golf O
however, O
within O
the O
first O
scene O
a O
young O
boy O
(Harry O
Vardon) O
is O
awaken O
by O
the O
voices O
of O
men. O
He O
goes O
outside O
to O
inquire O
what O
they O
are O
doing O
and O
is O
told O
they O
are O
going O
to O
build O
a O
golf O
something... O
So O
, O
then O
I O
turned O
the O
television O
off O
but O
something O
stirred O
me O
and O
it O
was O
back O
on. O
The O

the O

Upon O
viewing O
Tobe O

I O
developed O
a O

interest O
in O

a O
little O

The O

is O
your O
film. O

Maybe O
it O
was O
the O
title, O
or O
the O
trailer O
(certainly O
not O
the O
interview O
on O

which O
is O

the O
director B-DIRECTION
as O
he O
keeps O
saying O
"hi, O

into O
the O
camera B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
like O
a O
buffoon), O
but O
I O
had O
expectations O
for O
Entrails O
of O
a O
Virgin O
to O
be O
at O
least O
a O
bit O
of O
sleazy B-TONE

with O
some O
good B-CAST

way O
too O
sleazy B-TONE
for O
its O
own O

whatever. O
There's O
a O
problem- O
and O
one O
can O
see O
this O
also O
in O
the O
Italian O
sexploitation B-GENRE
flick O
Porno O
Holocaust, O
similar O
to O
this O

balance O
to O
the O
sex O

Too O
much O
sex O
and O
it O
will O
turn O

a O
prototypical O

not O
even O
with O
much O
production O
quality O
in O
comparison O
with O
most O
professional O
porno O
movies! O
And O
with O
the O
killing O
scenes, B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
there O
has O
to O
be O
at O
least O
a O
little O
tack, O
and O
maybe O
just O
a O
smidgen O
of O
ingenuity, O
in O
creating O
the O
creature/killer/whatever. O
Entrails O
of O
a O
Virgin O
has O
neither. O
It's O
safe O
to O
say O
it's O
a O
pretty O
soulless B-TONE
movie, O
even O
if O
isn't O
one O
of O
the O
very O
worst O
ever O

it's O
there O
just O
for O
horn-dog O

get O
off O

this O
case, O
we're O
given O
a O
photo B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
team O
where O
the O
guys O
are O
taking O
some O
shots B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
of O
some O
girls, O
nothing O
too O
salacious, O
and O
then O
by O
way O
of O
a O
dense O
fog O
they O
stay O
off O
at O
some O
house O
one O
night B-STORY

are O
picked O
off O
one O
by O
one O
by O
"A O

First O
off, O
the O
director B-DIRECTION
Kazuo O
'Gaira' O
Komizu O
decides O
he O
has O
to O
put O
in O
a O
quota O
of O
random O
sex O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
early O
on- O
we O
get O
spliced O
in O
(or O
phoned O
in, O
take O
your O
pick) O
clips O
of O
one O
of O
the O
photographers O
having O
sex O
with O
one O
or O
more O
of O
the O
girls O
elsewhere. O
It O
looks O
like O
it's O
from O
another O
movie. O
Then O
once O
settled O
into O
the O
house, O
there's O
a O
'wrestling' O
scene O
that's O
poorly O
choreographed O
and O
shot O
(yeah, O
we O
really O
need O
to O
see O
him O
'all' O
there), O
and O
then O
on O
to O
the O
rape O
and O
killings. O
First O
the O
rape, O
by O
the O
photographers, O
who O
promise O
the O
girls O
some O
jobs O
for O
their O
time. O
Then O
the O
Murderer, O
who O
like O
D'Amato's O
creature O
is O
simply O
covered O
in O
mud O
and O
given O
a O
stupid O
facial, O
and O
who O
for O
an O
unknown O
reason O
kills O
the O
men O
and/or O
rapes O
the O
women O
one O
by O
one.<br O
/><br O
/>Now, O
the O
latter O
of O
those, O
taken O
by O
themselves, O
should O
be O
considered O
the O
highlights O
of O
the O
movie. O
This O
is O
like O
saying, O
however, O
that O
the O
croûtons O
are O
the O
best O
part O
of O
a O
wretchedly O
tasting O
salad. O
An O
eye-gouging O
scene, O
a O
spike O
thrown O
like O
an O
Olympic O
event O
(that O
scene, O
actually, O
is O
kind O
of O
cool), B-MUSIC
and O
finally O
the O
entrailing O
of O
the O
overly O
sex-crazed O
girl, O
whose O
inconsequential O
name O
I O
can't O
remember. O
Even O
*this* O
becomes O
disappointing O
just O
by O
not O
being O
correct O
to O
the O
title! O
On O
top O
of O
this, O
the O
sex O
scenes, B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
which O
become O
tedious O
through O
'Gaira' O
and O
his O
indulgence O
in O
long-takes-without-cutaways O
where O
everything O
by O
the O
Japanese B-REMAKES
censors O
is O
blurred O
anyway, O
are O
dubbed O
over O
by O
the O
actors O
(you'd O
think O
that O
they O
seem O
to O
be O
enjoying O
themselves O
enough, O
hence O
the O
need O
to O
let O
them O
'speak' O
for O
themselves). O
But O
the O
overall O
feeling O
from O
Entrails O
of O
a O
Virgin O
is O
that O
of O
a O
lumpy O
one, O
where O
it's O
just O
there O
to O
be O
gawked O
at O
and O
without O
a O
shred O
of O
suspense B-GENRE

the O

This O

took O
me O
by O

I O
make O

a O
habit O
of O
finding O
out O
as O
little O
as O
possible O
about O
films O
before O
attending O

provide O
spoiler O

All O
I O
knew O
upon O
entering O
the O

is O
that O
it O
was O
a O
documentary O
about O
a O
long O

that O
IMDb O

gave O
it O

7.8, O

ranked O
it O
at O
7.9 O

the O

averaged O
an O
amazing O
8.2! O
If O
anything, O
they O
UNDERRATED O
this O
little O
gem.<br O
/><br O

Doug O

decided O
to O
record O
his O

"for O

at O

no O

where O
the O
filmmaker O
(Mike O

was O
going O
to O
take O

As O
a O

I O
doubt O
that O

The O

Number O

offers O
an O
intriguing O
premise O
that O
is O
undone O
by O
a O
weak O
execution. O
The O
film O
just O
failed O
on O
many O
different O
levels O
which O
is O
pretty O
disappointing O
because O
it O
held O
so O
much O

The O

was O
probably O
the O
worst O
part O
about O
it. O
It O
was O
filled O
with O
silly O

like O
the O

a O
good B-CAST

just O

know O
how O

running O
low O

reminds O
me O
that O
he's O
still O
capable O

making O
a O
stinker. O

has O
the O

drenched O
in O

he O
just O
can't O
get O
a O

He O
moves O
the O
film O
at O
a O
clunky B-CLICHES

switches O
from O

just O
very O

did O
the O

kiddy O
porn! O
I O
would O
advise O
anyone O
who O
has O
heard O
of O
this O
movie O
and O
was O
interested O
in O
seeing O
it O
to O
just O
forget O
about O
it O
and O
find O
another O
movie O
to O
watch! O
I O
was O
very O
disappointed!! O
The O
whole O
movie O
was O
a O
complete O
waste O
of O
time O
in O
my O
opinion. O

This O
is O
a O
typical O
Steele B-CAST
novel O
production O
in O
that O
two O
people O
who O
have O
undergone O
some O
sort O
of O
tragedy O
manage O
to O
get O
together O
despite O
the O
odds. O
I O
wouldn't O
call O
this O
a O
spoiler O
because O
anyone O
who O
has O
read O
a O
Steele B-CAST
novel O
knows O
how O
they O
ALL O
end. O
If O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
know O
much O
about O
the O
plot, B-CLICHES
don't O
keep O
reading.<br O
/><br O
/>Gilbert's O
character, O
Ophelia, O
is O
a O
woman O
of O
French O
decent O
who O
has O
lost O
her O
husband O
and O
son O
in O
an O
accident. B-STORY
Gilbert O
needs O
to O
stop O
doing O
films O
where O
she O
is O
required O
to O
have O
an O
accent O
because O
she, O
otherwise O
a O
good B-CAST
actress, B-CAST
cannot O
realistically O
pull O
off O
any O
kind O
of O
accent. O
Brad O
Johnson, O
also O
an O
excellent O
actor, B-CAST
is O
Matt, O
who O
is O
recovering O
from O
a O
rather O
nasty O
divorce. O
He O
is O
gentle, O
convincing B-PERFORMANCE
and O
compelling O
in O
this O
role.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
two O
meet O
on O
the O
beach O
through O
her O
daughter, O
Pip, O
and O
initially, O
Ophelia O
accuses O
Matt O
of O
being O
a O
child O
molester O
just O
because O
he O
talked O
art B-GENRE
with O
the O
kid. O
All O
of O
them O
become O
friends O
after O
this O
episode O
and O
then O
the O
couple O
falls O
in O
love.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
chemistry O
between O
the O
two O
leads O
is O
not O
great, O
even O
though O
the O
talent O
of O
these O
two O
people O
is O
not, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
a O
question. O
They O
did O
the O
best O
they O
could O
with O
a O
predictable B-CLICHES
plot B-CLICHES
and O
a O
script B-STORY
that O
borders O
on O
stereotypical. O
Two O
people O
meet, O
tragedy, O
bigger O
tragedy, O
a O
secret O
is O
revealed, O
another O
tragedy, O
and O
then O
they O
get O
together. O
I O
wish O
there O
was O
more O
to O
it O
than O
that, O
but O
there O
it O
is O
in O
a O
nutshell.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
wanted O
mindless B-TONE
entertainment, O
and O
I O
got O
it O
with O
this. O
In O
regard O
to O
the O
genre O
of O
romantic B-FRANCHISE
films, O
this O
one O
fails O
to O
be O
memorable. B-MUSIC
"A O
Secret O
Affair" O
with O
Janine O
Turner O

far O
superior O
(not O
a O
Steele B-CAST
book), O
as O
are O
some O
of O
Steele's O
earlier O
books O
turned O
into O

Oh O

i O
don't O
even O
remember O

seen. O
maybe O
it O
sells... O

not O
to O

not O
scary O
at O
all. O
the O

are O

very O
similar O

the O
dramaticness O
of O

kinda O
sucked... O

it O
lacked O
all O
dramaticness... O

this O
is O
for O
kids O
14-16 O
who O
listen O
to O
japanese B-REMAKES

and O
think O
they O
are O
so O
unique... O
we'll O
let O
me O
tell O
you. O
there's O
a O
million O

you O

this O

It's O
sad O

In O

BOTH O
elements O

While O
this O
does O
bring O
the O
former O
in O
spades, O
it O
sadly O
contains O
none O
of O
the O
latter. O
Furthermore O
you O
can't O
emphasize O
with O
any O
of O
the O
characters B-CAST

as O
thus, O
have O
absolutely O
no O

Technically O
not O
an O

the O
laziest O
one O
in O
the O

with O
the O

old O

Take O

there O
are O

Japanese B-REMAKES
horror B-GENRE
remakes O
are O
even O
worst. O
It O
only O
took O
The O
Ring, O
which O
was O
pitch-perfect O
(mostly O
because O
of O
Mr. O

to O
bring O
a O

e.g. O
The O

The O

the O

which O
is O
what O
one O
could O
expect O
from O
it. O
Plus, O
the O

some O

exactly O

dig O
too O
deep. O
Meanwhile, O
ghosts O
keep O
killing O

more O
deadlier O

not O
go O
militarily O

am O
quite O

never O
been O

borders O
on O
a O
cult B-FRANCHISE

even O
among O

I O
profusely O
apologize O
as O
a O
Canadian O
(because O
that's O
what O
we O

that O
this O

ever O

like O
everyone O

rented O
this O
movie O
believing O
it O
to O
be O
some O
stupid O
B-movie O
ripoff O
of O

I O
thought, O
"sure O
I O
could O
use O
a O
good B-CAST
laugh O
at O

I'll O
give O
the O
creators O
of O
this O

ONE O
positive O
comment O
about O

'creation': O

removing O

I O
can O
see O
how O
that O
would O
have O
been O
a O
distraction O
from O
seeing O
this O
movie.<br O
/><br O

for O
the O
record, O
I O
*saw* O
the O
movie, O
but O
did O
not O
watch O
it. O
The O
dialogue O
was O
incoherent O
and O
most O
of O
the O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
took O
place O
in O
my O
grandmother's O

I O
swear O
to O
God.<br O

know O
what? O
I'm O
not O

a O
wealthy O
Count. O
This O
is O
arranged O
by O
their O
father's O
accountant O
(King). O
The O
man O
he O
chooses O
is O
a O
full-time O
drunk O
(Auer), O
but O
the O
girls O
mistake O
him O
for O
an O
actual O
wealthy O
count O
(Milland). O
What O
a O
mess.<br O
/><br O
/>This O
is O
a O
delightful O
film, O
not O
cloying O
or O
overly O
sugary O
at O
all, O
with O
some O
nice O
performances, O
particularly O
by O
Auer, O
Milland, O
Barnes O
and O
Brady. O
The O
young O
women O
are O
pretty O
and O
all O
do O
good B-CAST
work. O
The O
emphasis, O
of O
course, O
is O
on O
young O
Durbin, O
who O
is O
a O
natural B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
actress B-CAST
and O
a O
beautifully-trained O
singer. O
In O
fact, O
her O
voice O
as O
a O
youngster O
is O
much O
more O
even O
than O
it O
would O
be O
as O
an O
adult O
- O
she O
has O
no O
trouble O
with O
the O
high O
notes, O
as O
she O
did O
later O
on O
because O
she O
put O
too O
much O
weight O
in O
the O
middle O
voice. O
She O
sings O
a O
delightful O
"Il O
Bacio" O
in O
a O
police O
station.<br O
/><br O
/>One O
of O
the O
nicest O
things O
about O
the O
film O
is O
to O
see O
the O
father, O
played O
by O
Charles O
Winninger, O
not O
want O
his O
children O
around O
- O
until O
he O
sees O
them O
and O
gets O
to O
know O
them. O
Barnes O
as O
the O
gold-digger O
isn't O
all O
that O
young, O
but O
the O
girls' O
mother O
looks O
way O
up O
there, O
so O
the O
inference O
probably O
was O
the O
older O
man O
seeking O
his O
youth O
with O
a O
younger, O
more O
glamorous O
woman. O
In O
fact, O
he O
finds O
the O
youth O
he O
was O
seeking O
in O
his O
daughters.<br O
/><br O
/>Universal O
gives O
Durbin O
the O
big O
star O
buildup O
here O
- O
she O
has O
the O
final O
shot O
in O
the O
movie. O
Ray O
Milland O
at O
this O
point O
was O
still O
paying O
his O
dues, O
and O
it O
will O
probably O
be O
a O
surprise O
even O
to O
film O
fans O
how O
young O
and O
attractive O
he O
is.<br O
/><br O
/>Very O
entertaining O
and O
of O
course, O
this O
led O
to O
a O
sequel B-FRANCHISE
and O
big O
stardom O
for O
Deanna. O

If O
anyone O
is O
wondering O
why O
no O
one O
makes O
movies O
like O
they O
used O
to, O
with O
conversation, O
character O
and O
a O
simple O
theme B-MUSIC
of O
friendship O
struggling O
to O
evolve O
into O
something O
new, O
better O
and O
different, O
those O
folks O
need O
to O
take O
in O
this O
film O
and O
see O
top O
notch O
writing, B-STORY
directing, B-DIRECTION
and O
acting B-CAST
that O
melds O
into O
a O
wonderful O
evening O
of O
observation O
on O
how O
things O
used O
to O
be O
in O
Italy O
and O
England. O
Other O
days, O
other O
times O
funneled O
into O
a O
terrific B-PERFORMANCE
comedy B-GENRE
of O
entertainment, O
made O
in O
1992 O
with O
Alfred O
Molina, O
Joan O
Plowright, O
Polly O
Walker, O
Josie O
Lawrence, O
Jim O
Broadbent, O
Miranda O
Richardson, O
and O
Michael O
Kitchens O
in O
the O
major O
roles. O
Under O
the O
brush O
stroke O
direction B-DIRECTION
of O
Mike O
Newell, O
these O
actors O
accomplish O
vividly O
memorable B-MUSIC
performances O
that O
are O
photographed O
with O
a O
sublimely O
subtle O
painter's O
eye. O
Reminiscent O
of O
the O
theatrical O
bedroom O
farce O
of O
the O
turn O
of O
the O
century, O
this O
film O
might O
be O
called O
a O
friendship O
farce O
that O
becomes O
a O
worthwhile O
experience O
in O
the O
growth O
of O
the O
romantic B-FRANCHISE
nature O
within O
each O
character, O
and O
the O
viewer, O
too. O
An O
artistic O
telegram O
on O
the O
importance O
of O
caring O
about O
those O
around O
us. O

I O
watched O
this O
series B-FRANCHISE
out O
of O
curiosity,wanting O
to O
see O
if O
they O
could O
possibly O
and O
with O
ALL O
this O
modern O
technology,out O
do O
Cecil O
B. O
DeMille's O
classic B-GENRE
epic B-GENRE
of O
1956, O
starring O
Charleton O
Heston,Yul O
Brenner O
and O
Sir O
Cedric O
Hardwicke. O
Of O
course, O
I O
was O
let O
down. O
Yes, O
they O
had O
all O
the O
Biblical O
characters B-CAST
correct, O
but O
they O
didn't O
give O
us O
any O
of O
the O
spectacular O
theatrical O
scenes, B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
that O
held O
your O
interest O
throughout O
the O
first O
movie. O
If O
you O
going O
to O
have O
a O
mini-series, O
you O
have O
to O
have O
some O
"rivoting" O
scenes, B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
the O
"Burning O
bush", O
Parting O
the O
"RED O
Sea",drowning O
"Pharohs O
Armies", O
"building O
Sethi's O
Pyramids", O
could O
have O
been O
done O
with O
todays' O
technology O
on O
the O
scale O
of O
blockbuster O
movies O
such O
as O
"Lord O
of O
the O
Rings" O
or O
the O
Matrix. O
Obviously, O
they O
didn't O
want O
to O
leave O
a O
LASTING O
impression O
of O
"faith O
and O
sacrifice", B-GENRE
which O
is O
much O
needed O
in O
these O
trouble O
times. O

Daniel O
Day-Lewis O
is O
the O
most O
versatile O
actor B-CAST
alive. O
English O
aristocratic O
snob O
in O
A O
Room O
With O
a O
View, O
passionate O
Irish O
thief O
in O
In O
the O
Name O
of O
the O
Father, O
an O
impudent, O
violent O
butcher O
in O
Gangs O
of O
New O
York O
(in O
a O
performance B-CAST
ten O
times O
stronger O
than O
Adrian O
Brody's O
in O
the O
Pianist) O
and O
as O
the O
outrageous O
Cristy O
Brown O
with O
cerebral O
palsy O
in O
My O
Left O
Foot O
(just O
to O
name O
a O
few). O
His O
roles O
all O
influence O
eachother, O
but O
each O
is O
seperate, O
and O
utterly O
unique. O
He O
changes O
completely, O
with O
each O
character O
he O
takes O
on. O
And O
I'm O
beginning O
to O
believe O
that O
he O
can O
act O
as O
anything. O
Anything.<br O
/><br O
/>As O
Cristy O
Brown O
he O
is O
stunning. O
He O
does O
not O
ridicule O
the O
character, O
and O
he O
does O
not O
pity O
the O
character. O
A O
difficult O
achievement. O
And O
Cristy O
Brown O
comes O
to O
life. O
A O
smart O
man. O
An O
outrageous O
man. O
Human.<br O
/><br O
/>This O
movie, O
despite O
small O
scene-transition O
faults O
and O
the O
like, O
is O
an O
inspiration. O
Yes, O
it's O
predictable. B-CLICHES
But O
is O
it O
stupidly O
sentimental? B-GENRE
No. O
I O
laughed. O
I O
cried. O
Not O
a O
single O
moment O
of O
cheese. O
Proof O
that O
this O
isn't O
a O
Hollywood O
movie.<br O
/><br O
/>My O
favourite O
scene O
is O
the O
scene O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
when O
Cristy O
is O
discussing O
painters O
with O
Eileen, O
Peter O
and O
her O
friends. O
Here's O
where O
Daniel O
Day-Lewis O
reaches O
an O
acting B-CAST
climax. O
"I'll O
kick O
you O
in O
the O
only O
part O
of O
your O
anatomy O
that's O
animated." O
"Wheel O
out O
the O
cripple!" O
And O
his O
performance B-CAST
never O
slows O
down, O
never O
falters, O
and O
is O
beautiful. O
Simply. O
He O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
screen O
time O
here. O
I O
watch O
it O
again O
again, O
and O
I O
never O
get O
tired O
of O
Cristy's O
perspicacious O
eyes, O
twitching O
and O
guttural O
speeches.<br O
/><br O
/>A O
must-see. O
Fo O
sho, O
yo! O

My O
guess O
would O
be O
this O
was O
originally O
going O
to O
be O
at O
least O
two O
parts, O
and O
thus O
at O
least O
a O
quarter O
longer, O
because O
otherwise O
how O
can O
one O
explain O
its O
confused, O
abbreviated O
storyline. O
I O
was O
never O
completely O
lost, O
but O
I O
was O
often O
partially O
lost O
and O
usually O
unclear O
on O
character O
motivation. B-STORY
The O
movie O
feels O
as O
though O
joining O
plot B-CLICHES
points O
were O
dropped O
to O
squeeze O
it O
into O
its O
time O
slot.<br O
/><br O
/>If O
it O
were O
longer, O
it O
might O
make O
more O
sense, O
but O
it O
still O
wouldn't O
be O
much O
good. B-CAST
The O
movie's O
most O
interesting O
idea O
is O
of O
the O
war B-GENRE
between O
Zeus O
and O
Hera O
as O
being O
a O
war B-GENRE
between O
the O
male O
and O
female, O
but O
the O
movie O
drops O
the O
ball O
on O
this, O
making O
Hera's O
followers O
fairly O
horrible O
while O
not O
being O
clear O
on O
what O
Zeus' O
followers O
do O
or O
believe. O
The O
movie O
is O
also O
interesting O
because O
you O
don't O
see O
the O
gods O
and O
there's O
no O
real O
certainty O
that O
they O
exist. O
So O
it's O
got O
a O
couple O
of O
intriguing O
ideas, O
but O
it O
doesn't O
do O
anything O
useful O
with O
them.<br O
/><br O
/>Bad O
dialog, O
cardboard O
characters, B-CAST
and O
one O
interesting O
scene O
involving O
Hercules O
and O
his O
three O
antagonistic O
sons. O
Not O
unwatchable O
but O
also O
not O
worth O
watching. O

Well, O
I O
like O
to O
watch O
bad O
horror B-GENRE
B-Movies, O
cause O
I O
think O
it's O
interesting O
to O
see O
stupidity O
and O
unability O
of O
creators O
to O
shoot O
seriously O
good B-CAST
movie. O
(I O
always O
compare O
this O
movies O
to O
- O
for O
example O
- O
some O
Spielberg's O
works O
and O
again-and-again O
don't O
understand O
the O
huge O
difference O
in O
what O
I O
see.) O
I O
like O
Ed O
Wood's O
movies O
cause O
it's O
so O
inept O
it's O
very O
funny. B-HUMOR
But O
people!!! O
"The O
Chilling" B-MUSIC
is O
not O
funny B-HUMOR
and O
is O
not O
even O
"interesting". O
It's O
EXTREMELY O
BORING B-TONE
horror B-GENRE
movie O
without O
ANYTHING O
what O
makes O
even O
bad O
movies O
watchable. O
There's O
no O
acting, B-CAST
no O
screenplay, O
no O
direction, B-DIRECTION
no O
thrills O
and O
not O
even O
blood. O
It's O
extremely O
inept O
amateurish B-TONE
film. O
It's O
definitely O
the O
WORST O
movie O
I O
had O
ever O
seen O
(and O
I O
had O
seen O
a O
lot O
of O
"worst O
movies" O
- O
believe O
me). O
I O
warned O
you O
!!! O
1/10 O

This O
IS O
the O
worst O
movie O
I O
have O
ever O
seen, O
as O
well O
as, O
the O
worst O
that O
I O
will O
probably O
EVER O
see. O
I O
see O
no O
need O
to O
rehash O
what O
all O
the O
others O
have O
said O
previously, O
just O
be O
forewarned...<br O
/><br O
/>This O
IS O
NOT O
one O
of O
those O
bad O
movies O
you O
think O
you O
want O
to O
watch O
because O
you O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
make O
fun B-PERFORMANCE
of O
it, O
its O
just O
plain O
BAD O
BAD O
BAD O
BAD O
BAD.<br O
/><br O
/>This O
movie O
is O
the O
equivalent O
to O
having O
a O
"pet O
rock" O
as O
your O
friend. O
You O
wait O
and O
wait O
and O
wait O
and O
wait O
and O
wait O
and O
wait O
and O
wait O
and O
wait O
for O
something O
to O
happen. O
Unfortunately, O
it O
never O
does. O
At O
least O
with O
a O
pet O
rock O
you O
knew O
what O
you O
were O
getting O
into. O
Lion's O
Gate O
completely O
deceives O
on O
this O
bombshell... O
No...this O
is O
a O
disaster. O
After O
watching O
this O
film, O
you O
would O
swear O
George O
W. O
Bush O
had O
his O
hands O
all O
over O
the O
making O
of O
this O
film... O
yes O
its O
that O
idiotic.<br O
/><br O
/>Stay O
away, O
unless O
of O
course O
you O
just O
want O
to O
watch O
the O
worst O
movie O
of O
all O
time. O
Its O
probably O
how O
Lion's O
Gate O
figured O
it O
would O
make O
some O
money O
off O
this O
piece O
of O
tripe. O

I O
have O
been O
a O
Mario O
fan O
for O
as O
long O
as O
I O
can O
remember, O
I O
have O
very O
fond O
memories O
of O
playing O
Super O
Mario O
World O
as O
a O
kid, O
this O
game O
has O
brought O
back O
many O
of O
those O
memories O
while O
adding O
something O
new. O
Super O
Mario O
Galaxy O
is O
the O
latest O
installment O
in O
the O
amazing O
Mario O
franchise. O
There O
is O
much O
very O
different O
about O
this O
game O
from O
any O
other O
Mario O
before O
it, O
while O
still O
keeping O
intact O
the O
greatest O
elements O
of O
Mario, O
the O
first O
noticeable O
difference O
is O
that O
the O
story B-STORY
takes O
place O
in O
space.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
story B-STORY
begins O
much O
like O
any O
other O
Mario O
game, O
Mario O
receives O
a O
letter O
from O
Princess O
Peach O
inviting O
him O
to O
a O
celebration O
at O
her O
castle O
in O
the O
Mushroom O
Kingdom. O
Upon O
arriving O
at O
Peach's O
castle O
Mario O
finds O
Bowser O
and O
his O
son O
(Bowser O
Jr.) O
attacking O
the O
castle O
with O
their O
airships. O
Bowser O
kidnaps O
Princess O
Peach O
and O
then O
lifts O
her O
castle O
up O
into O
space. O
In O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
castle O
being O
lifted O
into O
space O
Mario O
falls O
off O
and O
lands O
on O
an O
unknown O
planet. O
Mario O
is O
found O
by O
a O
talking O
star O
named O
Luma O
and O
is O
taken O
back O
to O
the O
Luma's O
home, O
a O
floating O
space O
station, O
here O
Mario O
meets O
many O
other O
Lumas O
and O
also O
meets O
their O
leader, O
a O
woman O
named O
Rosalina. O
Rosalina O
tells O
Mario O
that O
Bowser O
has O
taken O
away O
the O
space O
station's O
Power O
Stars O
and O
scattered O
them O
across O
the O
universe, B-FRANCHISE
it O
is O
up O
to O
Mario O
to O
help O
the O
Lumas O
find O
them O
and O
save O
Peach, O
thus O
the O
adventure B-GENRE
begins.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
way O
you O
play O
the O
game O
is O
by O
flying O
from O
the O
space O
station O
to O
other O
galaxies, O
each O
galaxy O
consists O
of O
multiple O
planets O
that O
Mario O
travels O
amongst O
in O
levels O
via O
these O
shooting O
stars O
to O
retrieve O
the O
Power O
Stars. O
Mario O
can O
at O
many O
times O
walk O
all O
the O
way O
around O
planets O
without O
losing O
gravity, O
some O
planets O
are O
small O
and O
others O
are O
big, O
many O
planets O
are O
similar O
to O
classic B-GENRE
Mario O
environments. O
The O
best O
thing O
about O
the O
game O
are O
the O
controls, O
all O
of O
the O
stuff O
like O
jumping O
and O
such O
is O
still O
the O
same, O
but O
the O
wiimote O
is O
used O
in O
many O
unique O
ways O
in O
this O
game. O
You O
shake O
the O
remote O
Mario O
will O
perform O
a O
spin O
that O
is O
used O
as O
the O
primary O
attack O
in O
the O
game, O
and O
it O
will O
as O
well O
activate O
the O
shooting O
stars. O
You O
can O
also O
point O
the O
remote O
at O
the O
screen O
and O
use O
the O
pointer O
to O
fire O
star O
bits O
at O
enemies O
or O
objects O
in O
the O
environment. O
Then O
there O
is O
the O
graphics, O
these O
are O
by O
far O
the O
best O
graphics O
on O
the O
Wii, O
it O
is O
just O
so O
hard O
to O
describe O
how O
great O
this O
game O
looks, O
you O
could O
probably O
almost O
say O
it O
looks O
as O
good B-CAST
as O
some O
360 O
games.<br O
/><br O
/>My O
only O
minor O
gripes O
is O
that O
the O
going O
upside O
down O
effect O
takes O
some O
getting O
used O
to, O
and O
also O
the O
story B-STORY
is O
pretty O
weak. O
The O
worst O
part O
is O
that O
you O
lose O
all O
of O
your O
lives O
when O
you O
turn O
off O
the O
game, O
no O
matter O
how O
many O
you O
had O
when O
you O
last O
quit O
you O
restart O
at O
4 O
lives. O
Still O
these O
minor O
problems O
aside O
it's O
a O
superb O
game O
that O
is O
highly O
entertaining O
and O
is O
very O
challenging. O
This O
is O
the O
type O
of O
game O
that O
we've O
been O
waiting O
for O
on O
the O
Wii.<br O

perfect O
10 O
out O
of O
10! O

This O
short B-CAST
film O
that O
inspired O
the O
soon-to-be O
full O
length O
feature O
- O
Spatula O
Madness O
- O
is O
a O
hilarious B-TONE
piece O
that O
contends O
against O
similar O
cartoons O
yielding O
multiple O
writers. O
The O
short B-CAST
film O
stars O
Edward O
the O
Spatula O
who O
after O
being O
fired O
from O
his O
job, O
joins O
in O
the O
fight B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
against O
the O
evil O
spoons. O
This O
premise O
allows O
for O
some O
funny B-HUMOR
content O
near O
the O
beginning, O
but O
is O
barely O
present O
for O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
feature. O
This O
film's O
15-minute O
running O
time O
is O
absorbed O
by O
some O
odd-ball O
comedy B-GENRE
and O
a O
small O
musical B-REMAKES
number. O
Unfortunately O
not O
much O
else O
lies O
below O
it. O
The O
plot B-CLICHES
that O
is O
set O
up O
doesn't O
really O
have O
time O
to O
show. O
But O
it's O
surely O
follows O
it O
plot B-CLICHES
better O
than O
many O
high-budget O
Hollywood O
films. O
This O
film O
is O
worth O
watching O
at O
least O
a O
few O
times. O
Take O
it O
for O
what O
it O
is, O
and O
don't O
expect O
a O
deep O
story. B-STORY

Okay, O
last O
night, B-STORY
August O
18th, O
2004, O
I O
had O
the O
distinct O
displeasure O
of O
meeting O
Mr. O
Van O
Bebble O
at O
a O
showing O
of O
the O
film O
The O
Manson O
Family B-FRANCHISE
at O
the O
Three O
Penny O
in O
Chicago O
as O
part O
of O
the O
Chicago O
Underground O
Film O
Festival. O
Here's O
what O
I O
have O
to O
say O
about O
it. O
First O
of O
all, O
the O
film O
is O
an O
obvious O
rip O
off O
of O
every O
Kenneth O
Anger, O
Roman O
Polanski, O
Oliver O
Stone B-CAST
and O
Terry O
Gilliam O
movie O
I've O
ever O
seen. O
Second O
of O
all, O
in O
a O
short B-CAST
Q O
& O
A O
session O
after O
the O
show O
Mr. O
Van O
Bebble O
immediately O
stated O
that O
he O
never O
made O
any O
contact O
with O
the O
actual O
Manson O
Family B-FRANCHISE
members O
or O
Charlie O
himself, O
calling O
them O
liars O
and O
saying O
he O
wanted O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
them, O
that O
the O
film O
was O
based O
on O
his O
(Van O
Bebble's) O
take O
on O
the O
trial O
having O
seen O
it O
all O
from O
his O
living O
room O
on O
TV O
and O
in O
the O
news O
(and O
I'm O
assuming O
from O
the O
Autobiography O
and O
the O
book O
Helter O
Skelter O
which O
were O
directly O
mimicked O
through O
the O
narrative). B-STORY
So O
I O
had O
second O
dibs O
on O
questions, O
I O
asked O
if O
he O
was O
trying O
to O
present O
the O
outsider, O
Mtv, O
sex O
drugs O
and O
rock O
'n O
roll O
version O
and O
not O
necessarily O
the O
true O
story. B-STORY
This O
question O
obviously O
pissed O
off O
the O
by O
now O
sloshed O
director B-DIRECTION
who O
started O
shouting O
"f*** O
you, O
shut O
the O
f*** O
up, O
this O
is O
the O
truth! O
All O
those O
other O
movies O
are O
bullsh**!"<br O
/><br O
/>Well O
anyway, O
I O
didn't O
even O
think O
about O
how O
ridiculous B-TONE
this O
was O
until O
the O
next O
day O
when O
I O
read O
the O
tagline O
for O
the O
film, O
"You've O
heard O
the O
laws O
side O
of O
the O
story...now O
hear O
the O
story B-STORY
as O
it O
is O
told O
by O
the O
Manson O
Family." B-FRANCHISE
Excuse O
me, O
if O
this O
guy O
has O
never O
even O
spoken O
to O
the O
family B-FRANCHISE
and O
considers O
them O
to O
be O
liars O
that O
he O
doesn't O
want O
to O
have O
anything O
to O
do O
with, O
how O
in O
God's O
name O
can O
he O
tell O
the O
story B-STORY
for O
them!? O
This O
is O
the O
most O
ridiculous B-TONE
statement O
I O
have O
ever O
heard! O
The O
film O
was O
obviously O
catered O
to O
the O
sex O
drugs O
and O
rock O
'n O
roll O
audience O
that O
it O
had O
no O
trouble O
in O
attracting O
to O
the O
small, O
dimly O
lit O
theatre, O
and O
was O
even O
more O
obviously O
spawned O
by O
the O
sex O
drugs O
and O
rock O
'n O
roll O
mind O
of O
a O
man O
who O
couldn't O
even O
watch O
his O
own O
film O
without O
getting O
up O
every O
ten O
minutes O
to O
go O
get O
more O
beer O
or O
to O
shout O
some O
sort O
of O
Rocky O
Horroresque O
call O
line O
to O
the O
actors O
on O
screen. O
This O
film O
accomplishes O
little O
more O
than O
warping O
the O
public's O
image O
of O
actual O
events O
(which O
helped O
shape O
the O
state O
of O
America O
and O
much O
of O
the O
world O
today) O
into O
some O
sort O
of O
Slasher/Comic O
Book/Porno/Rape O
fantasy B-GENRE
dreamed O
up O
by O
an O
obviously O
shallow O
individual.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
film O
was O
definitely O
very O
impressive B-PERFORMANCE
to O
look O
at. O
The O
soundtrack B-MUSIC
was O
refreshing O
as O
it O
contained O
actual O
samples O
of O
Charlie's O
work O
with O
the O
Family B-FRANCHISE
off O
of O
his O
Lie O
album. O
The O
editing B-DIRECTION
was O
nice O
and O
choppy O
to O
simulate O
the O
nauseating O
uncertainty O
of O
most O
modern O
music B-MUSIC
videos. O
All O
in O
all O
this O
film O
would O
have O
made O
a O
much O
better O
addition O
to O
the O
catalogues O
at O
Mtv O
than O
to O
the O
Underground O
Film O
Festival O
or O
for O
that O
matter O
the O
minds O
of O
any O
intellectual O
observers. O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
at O
a O
midnight O
Rocky O
Horror B-GENRE
viewing O
the O
way O
the O
audience O
was O
dressed O
and O
behaving O
(probably O
the O
best O
part O
of O
the O
experience). O
The O
cast B-CAST
was O
very O
good B-CAST
with O
the O
exception O
of O
Charlie O
who O
resembled O
some O
sort O
of O
stoned O
Dungeons O
and O
Dragons O
enthusiast O
more O
than O
the O
actual O
role O
he O
was O
portraying. O
The O
descriptions O
the O
film O
gave O
of O
him O
as O
full O
of O
energy, O
throwing O
ten O
things O
at O
you O
and O
being O
very O
physical B-HUMOR
about O
it O
all O
the O
while O
did O
not O
match O
at O
all O
the O
slow, B-TONE
lethargic, O
and O
chubby O
representation O
that O
was O
actually O
presented.<br O
/><br O
/>All O
in O
all O
the O
film O
basically O
explains O
itself O
as O
Sadie O
(or O
maybe O
it O
was O
Linda) O
declares O
at O
the O
end, O
"You O
can O
write O
a O
bunch O
of O
bullsh** O
books O
or O
make O
a O
bunch O
of O
bullsh** O
movies...etc. O
etc." O
Case O
in O
point. O
Even O
the O
disclaimer O
"Based O
on O
a O
True O
Story" B-STORY
is O
a O
dead O
giveaway, O
signalling O
that O
somewhere O
beneath O
this O
psychedelic O
garbage O
heap O
lay O
the O
foundation O
of O
an O
actual O
story B-STORY
with O
content O
that O
will O
make O
and O
has O
made O
a O
difference O
in O
the O
world. O
All O
you O
have O
to O
do O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
alchemy O
to O
separate O
the O
truth O
from O
the O
the O
crap, O
or O
actually, O
maybe O
you O
could O
just O
avoid O
it O
all O
together O
and O
go O
read O
a O
book O
instead.<br O
/><br O
/>All O
I O
can O
say O
is O
this, O
when O
the O
film O
ended O
I O
got O
a O
free O
beer O
so O
I'm O
glad O
I O
went, O
but O
not O
so O
glad O
I O
spent O
fifteen O
dollars O
on O
my O
ticket O
to O
be O
told O
to O
shut O
the O
f*** O
up O
for O
asking O
the O
director B-DIRECTION
a O
question. O
Peace. O

I O
bought O
this O
game O
on O
an O
impulse O
buy O
from O
walmart. O
I O
am O
glad O
I O
did. O
It O
was O
very O
entertaining O
listening O
to O
Sean O
Connery B-CAST
and O
playing O
the O
game. O
I O
thought O
the O
graphics O
were O
the O
best O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
a O
movie/game O
remake. B-REMAKES
The O
bonus O
levels O
were O
very O
hard! O
The O
sniper O
one O
I O
think O
was O
too O
hard, O
it O
made O
me O
so O
frustrated O
I O
didn't O
play O
the O
game O
for O
a O
week O
and O
a O
half. O
There O
were O
too O
many O
people O
shooting O
at O
you O
with O
nothing O
to O
hide O
behind O
or O
life O
to O
handle O
it. O
<br O
/><br O
/>The O
only O
thing O
I O
might O
change O
was O
the O
upgrade O
system. O
I O
didn't O
notice O
any O
difference O
from O
un-upgraded O
equipment O
to O
the O
upgraded, O
such O
as O
buying O
an O
armor B-CLICHES
upgrade O
didn't O
seem O
to O
make O
the O
armor B-CLICHES
stronger O
or O
more O
filling O
on O
my O
life O
meter. O
I O
really O
liked O
the O
Q O
copter. O
I O
think O
the O
developers O
did O
a O
good B-CAST
job. O

No, O
this O
hilariously O
horrible O
70's O
made-for-TV O
horror B-GENRE
clinker O
isn't O
about O
a O
deadly O
demonically O
possessed O
dessert O

Still, O
this O
exceptionally O
awful, O
yet O
undeniably O
amusing O
and O
thus O
enjoyable O
cathode O
ray O
refuse O
reaches O
a O
breathtaking O
apex O
of O
absolute, O
unremitting O
silliness O
and O
atrociousness O
that's O
quite O
tasty O
in O
a O
so-execrable-it's-downright-awesome O

exactly O
what O

about O
4 O

This O

like O

contrives O

this O
about, O

five O

nuts. O
Everyone O

so O
that O

Marion O

in O
this O
remarkable O
comedy B-GENRE
"Show O

released O
by O
MGM O
in O
1928. O
Davies O
plays O
a O
hick O
from O
Savannah, O
Georgia, O
who O
arrives O
in O
Hollywood O
with O
her O
father O
(Dell O

The O
jalopy O
they O
arrive O
in O
is O
a O
hoot O
- O
as O
is O
Davies O
outrageous O
southern O
costume. O
Davies O
lands O
a O
job O
in O
slapstick B-HUMOR
comedy, B-GENRE
not O
what O
she O
wants, O
but O
it O

She O
meets O
fellow O
slapstick B-HUMOR

William O

who O
is O
immediately O
smitten O
with O

Well, O

then O
gets O
a O

at O
a O
more O
prestigious O

and O
lands O

stuffy O

A O
handsome O
but O
fake O
actor B-CAST
(Andre O

shows O
her O
the O
ropes O
of O
how O
to O
be O
the O
typical O
pretentious O
Hollywood O
star. O
Davies O
abandons O
her O
slapstick B-HUMOR
friend O
and O
father O
for O
the O
good B-CAST
life, O
but O
of O
course O
learns O
that O
is O
not O
who O

is. O
Marion O
Davies O
is O
wonderful O
throughout, O
as O
she O
- O
outrageously O

runs O
the O

of O
a O

the O
director B-DIRECTION

This O

a O
silent B-CINEMATOGRAPHY

with O
a O
few O
"sound O

The O

are O
excellently O
NATURAL B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
which O

what O

the O

so O
brilliantly O

However, O
I O
am O
rather O
surprised O
to O
see O
that O
this O

not O

some O
of O
the O

director, B-DIRECTION
Attenborough's O
credits O
that O
puzzles O
me: O
aren't O
they O
proud O
of O

claim O
that O
they O
have O
made O
such O
excellent, O
long O

for O
the O

I O
am O
hoping O
I O
would O
get O
some O
answers O
to O
my O
puzzles O
from O
some O
one O
(possibly O
one O
of O
the O
"knowledgeable" O
personnel O
(insider) O
of O
the O

While O

the O

was O
mostly O
boring, B-TONE
Star O

The O

bad. O
In O
this O
terrible O

the O

is O
on O
shore O
leave O

they O
get O
a O

from O
the O

that O

representing O
Earth, O
Romulus O

Kronos O
(the O
Klingon O
home O
world) O
have O
been O
kidnapped O
by O
a O
renegade O
Vulcan O
bent O
on O
his O
quest O
to O
attain O
a O
starship O
to O
venture O
into O
the O
great O
barrier. O
There, O
he O
hopes O
to O
find O
God. O
Using O
mysticism O
and O
bad O
writing, B-STORY
he O
persuades O
many O
of O
the O
senior O
officers O
of O
the O
Enterprise O
to O
betray O
Kirk O
and O
get O
a O
hold O
of O
the O

They O
do O
reach O
the O
inside O
of O
the O
great O
barrier O
and O
find O
a O
planet O
where O
they O
do O
meet O
a O
god-like O
alien. O
This O
one O
is O
so O
bad O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
figure O
out O
where O
to O
begin. O
At O
the O
core O
is O
a O
good B-CAST
idea O
that O
is O
never O
really O
developed. O
The O
plot B-CLICHES
goes O
nowhere O
instead O
of O
where O
no O
man O
has O
gone O
before. O
It O
is O
almost O
like O
the O
writers O
had O
no O
idea O
how O
to O
end O
this O
fiasco. O
The O
action B-GENRE
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
don't O
have O
the O
suspense B-GENRE
of O
Wrath O
of O
Kahn, O
the O
philosophy O
is O
boring, B-TONE
and O
the O
humor O
is O
stale. B-TONE
Now O
I O
will O
focus O
most O
of O
my O
anger O
on O
William O
Shatner. O
When O
he O
takes O
the O
director's O
chair, O
the O
ego O
gets O
bigger. O
Most O
of O
the O
focus O
is O
on O
him, O
Spock, O
and O
McCoy, O
but O
does O
not O
give O
the O
others O
enough O
to O
do. O
Moreover, O
whereas O
Shatner O
is O
usually O
guilty O
of O
over-acting O
in O
previous O
movies O
and O
television O
spots, O
he O
is O
just O
plain O
bad O
in O
this O
one. O
Now O
Kirk O
is O
reckless, O
a O
practical B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
jokers, O
and O
silly. O
One O
of O
the O
worst O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
involves O
the O
three O
leaders O
singing O
the O
song, O
"Row O
Row O
Row O
your O
Boat" O
in O
a O
round O
by O
a O
campfire. O
In O
any O
case, O
this O
is O
the O
worst O
of O
the O
Star O
Trek O
franchise. O
I O
should O
have O
given O
it O
three O
out O
of O
ten O
instead O
of O
five. O

Despite O
later O
claims, O
this O
early-talkie O
melodrama O
has O
very O
little O
in O
common O
with O
"Citizen O
Kane": O
It's O
a O
biopic O
of O
a O
ruthless O
but O
human O
fictional O
plutocrat, O
told O
in O
flashback O
but O
hopping O
around O
time. O
The O
scriptwriter, O
Preston O
Sturges, O
shows O
none O
of O
his O
later O
gift O
for O
sparkling O
dialog, O
and O
none O
of O
the O
myriad O
cinematic B-MUSIC
innovations O
of O
"Kane" O
are O
evident. O
Still, O
it's O
very O
watchable, O
with O
a O
young O
Spencer O
Tracy O
(his O
old-man O
makeup O
makes O
him O
look O
just O
like, O
well, O
an O
old O
Spencer O
Tracy) O
showing O
depth O
and O
authority, O
and O
Colleen O
Moore O
-- O
a O
little O
past O
her O
prime, O
and O
not O
physically O
well O
matched O
-- O
playing O
a O
multifaceted O
woman-behind-the-man. O
There's O
also O
Helen O
Vinson O
as O
one O
of O
the O
most O
treacherous O
femmes O
fatales O
in O
movie O
history, O
sending O
the O
final O
third O
into O
ecstatic O
soap-opera O
reverberations. O
The O
surviving O
print O
is O
jumpy O
and O
has O
missing O
audio O
snippets, O
and O
there O
are O
some O
plot B-CLICHES
holes B-STORY
left O
open O
(how O
would O
she O
know O
whose O
son O
it O
was O
if O
she's O
sleeping O
with O
both O
of O
them?), O
and O
the O
music B-MUSIC
is O
awfully O
hokey. O
For O
all O
that, O
I O
was O
quite O
fascinated. O

This O
is O
the O
best O
version O
(so O
far) O
that O
you O
will O
see O
and O
the O
most O
true O
to O
the O
Bronte O
work. O
Dalton O
is O
a O
little O
tough O
to O
imagine O
as O
Rochester O
who O
Jane O
Eyre O
declared O
"not O
handsome". O
But O
his O
acting B-CAST
overcomes O
this O
and O
Zelah O
Clark, O
pretty O
as O
she O
is, O
is O
also O
a O
complete O
and O
believable B-PERFORMANCE
Jane O
Eyre. O
This O
production O
is O
a O
lengthy O
watch O
but O
well O
worth O
it. O
Nearly O
direct O
quotes O
from O
the O
book O
are O
in O
the O
script B-STORY
and O
if O
you O
want O
the O
very O
first O
true O
'romance' B-STORY
in O
literature, O
this O
is O
the O
way O
to O
see O
it. O
I O
own O
every O
copy O
of O
this O
movie O
and O
have O
read O
and O
re-read O
the O
original. O
The O
filming O
may O
seem O
a O
little O
dated B-CLICHES
now O
but O
there O
will O
never O
be O
another O
like O
this. O

Apparently, O
the O
people O
that O
wrote O
the O
back O
of O
the O
box O
did O
not O
bother O
to O
watch O
this O
so-called O
"movie." O
They O
described O
"blindingly O
choreographed O
intrigue B-STORY
and O
violence." B-GENRE
I O
saw O
no O
"intrigue." B-STORY
I O
instead O
saw O
a O
miserable O
attempt O
at O
dialogue O
in O
a O
supposed O
kung O
fu O
movie. O
I O
saw O
no O
"violence." B-GENRE
At O
least, O
I O
saw O
nothing O
which O
could O
cause O
me O
to O
suspend O
my O
disbelief O
as O
to O
what O
could O
possibly O
hurt O
a O
man O
with O
"impervious" O
skin--but O
here O
I O
am O
perhaps O
revealing O
too O
much O
of O
the O
"plot." B-CLICHES
Furthermore, O
as O
a O
viewer O
of O
many O
and O
sundry O
films O
(some O
of O
which O
include O
the O
occasional O
kung O
fu O
movie), O
I O
can O
authoritatively O
say O
that O
this O
piece O
of O
celluloid O
is O
unwatchable. O
Whatever O
you O
may O
choose O
to O
do, O
I O
will O
always O
remain<br O

Jonathan O
Tanner O

/><br O

<br O
/><br O

I O
was O
not O
blinded O
by O
the O
choreography. O

I O
liked O
Boyle's O
performance, B-CAST
but O
that's O
about O
the O
only O
positive O
thing O
I O
can O
say. O
Everything O
was O
overdone B-TONE
to O
the O
point O
of O
absurdity. O
Most O
of O
the O
actors O
spoke O
like O
you O
would O
expect O
your O
9-year-old O
nephew O
to O
speak O
if O
he O
were O
pretending O
to O
be O
a O
jaded, O
stone-hearted O
cop, O
or O
an O
ultra-evil O
villain. B-CLICHES
The O
raspy O
voice-overs O
seemed O
amateurish B-TONE
to O
me. O
I O
could O
go O
buy O
a O
cheap B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
synthesizer O
and O
crank O
out O
better O
opening O
music. B-MUSIC
And O
what's O
with O
the O
whole O
1984ish O
police O
torture O
stuff? O
It O
was O
totally O
superfluous O
and O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
actual O
events O
of O
the O
story. B-STORY
Cox O
added O
a O
lot O
of O
things, O
in O
fact, O
that O
he O
apparently O
thought O
would O
be O
really O
cool, B-MUSIC
but O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
story. B-STORY
That's O
a O
big O
disappointment O
because O
one O
of O
the O
things O
that O
makes O
Borges' O
stories O
so O
good B-CAST
is O
his O
minimalism O
-- O
they O
are O
tightly O
bound, O
with O
no O
superfluous O
details. O
This O
movie O
is O
just O
the O
opposite. O
I O
stopped O
watching O
after O
the O
scene O
where O
Lonnrot O
is O
questioning O
the O
guy O
from O
the O
Yidische O
Zaitung, O
or O
thereabouts. O
I O
wasted O
$4 O
renting O
this, O
but O
at O
least O
I O
can O
get O
some O
satisfaction O
from O
writing B-STORY
this O
review O
and O
hopefully O
saving O
others O
from O
making O
the O
same O
mistake. O

It's O
terrific B-PERFORMANCE
when O
a O
funny B-HUMOR
movie O
doesn't O
make O
smile O
you. O
What O
a O
pity!! O
This O
film O
is O
very O
boring B-TONE
and O
so O
long. O
It's O
simply O
painfull. O
The O
story B-STORY
is O
staggering O
without O
goal O
and O
no O
fun.<br O
/><br O
/>You O
feel O
better O
when O
it's O
finished. O

So O
well O
made, O
no O
CGI B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
crap. O
Has O
anyone O
else O
been O
on O
the O
"Jumping O
Crocs" O
tour O
of O
Darwin's O
Adelaide O
River O
before? O
Black B-HUMOR
Water O
was O
WAY O
realistic; O
Rogue O
was O
a O
bit O
cringeworthy.<br O
/><br O
/>Thought O
the O
blonde O
chick O
was O
excellent O
in O
it O
- O
haven't O
really O
seen O
her O
before. O
And O
the O
other O
chick O
is O
a O
babe, O
she O
is O
always O
excellent. O
<br O
/><br O
/>V. O
suspenseful O
- O
I O
would O
compare O
it O
to O
Jaws O
over O
any O
other O
man O
eating O
animal O
flick. O
<br O
/><br O

the O

Aussie O
thing O
down O

without O
going O
OTT O
with O
struths O
and O

it! O

The O
Assignment O
is O
an O
outstanding O
thriller B-GENRE
with O
several O
plot B-CLICHES
twists B-STORY
driven O
by O
character, O
rather O
than O
star O
turns, O
the O
need O
to O
stage O
special B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
effects, O
obligatory O
romance, B-STORY
and O
endless O
car O
chases. O
However, O
there O
is O
a O
car O
chase O
in O
here, O
and O
a O
dandy O
it O
is. O
Aidan O
Quinn O
is O
wonderful O
as O
both O
the O
terrorist O
and O
the O
naval O
officer O
"recruited" O
to O
eliminate O
him. O
It O
is O
rare O
that O
a O
second O
or O
third O
tier O
actor, B-CAST
such O
as O
Quinn, O
is O
given O
an O
important O
starring O
role O
like O
this O
that O
carries O
a O
film. O
Usually, O
such O
a O
role O
is O
given O
to O
an O
A-list O
actor B-CAST
with O
box O
office O
draw, O
which O
is O
probably O
why O
I O
never O
heard O
of O
this O
film O
before O
I O
saw O
it. O
Donald O
Sutherland O
is O
great O
as O
the O
morally O
ambiguous, B-TONE
somewhat O
creepy O
at O
times, O
agent O
that O
recruits O
Quinn. O
Ben O
Kingsley O
is O
fine O
also O
as O
the O
Israeli O
agent. O
The O
plot B-CLICHES
is O
very O
complex O
and O
there O
are O
multiple O
story B-STORY
lines, O
which O
converge O
in O
gradual O
fashion O
toward O
the O
end, O
and O
not O
all O
at O
once O
as O
we're O
used O
to O
seeing. O
The O
paranoia O
and O
claustrophobia O
of O
these O
type O
of O
thrillers O
is O
captured O
and O
portrayed O
with O
both O
moral O
ambiguity O
and O
frightening O
intensity. O
The O
locations O
are O
convincing B-PERFORMANCE
and O
effective. O
The O
soundtrack B-MUSIC
is O
nothing O
special, B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
but O
rarely O
do O
we O
get O
all O
of O
the O
above O
mentioned O
qualities O
these O
days, O
without O
dumb O
and/or O
meaningless O
plot B-CLICHES
developments; O
unconvincing B-PERFORMANCE
star O
turns; O
loud, O
annoying, O
music B-MUSIC
video O
type O
soundtracks; O
a O
villain B-CLICHES
that O
hams O
it O
up; O
and O
repeatedly O
a O
cast, B-CAST
costumes, O
and O
plot B-CLICHES
that O
cater O
mostly O
to O
an O
audience O
under O
25. O
This O
is O
an O
outstanding O
thriller, B-GENRE
which O
most O
assuredly O
did O
not O
get O
its O
just O
due O
upon O
its O
release. O

Set O
in O
the O
1794, O
the O
second O
year O
of O
the O
French O
republic O
formed O
after O
the O
execution O
of O
Louis O
XVI, O
this O
film O
portrays O
the O
power O
struggle B-STORY
between O
the O
revolutionary O
leaders O
Danton O
(Gerard O
Depardieu, B-CAST
at O
his O
finest) O
and O
Robespierre O
(a O
commanding O
performance B-CAST
by O
the O
Polish O
actor B-CAST
Wojciech O
Pszoniak). B-CAST
The O
moderate O
revolutionary O
Danton O
has O
returned O
to O
Paris O
from O
his O
country B-MUSIC
seat O
where O
he O
has O
been O
since O
being O
deposed O
as O
leader O
of O
the O
Committee O
of O
Public O
Safety O
in O
the O
previous O
year O
by O
Robespierre. O
He O
is O
opposed O
to O
"The O
Reign O
Of O
Terror" O
which O
has O
resulted O
in O
the O
executions O
of O
thousands O
of O
citizens, O
mainly O
by O
guillotine, O
who O
are O
thought O
to O
be O
opposed O
to O
the O
Revolution. O
Danton O
is O
confident O
of O
the O
support O
of O
the O
ordinary O
people O
and O
tries O
to O
persuade O
Robespierre O
to O
curb O
the O
bloodletting. O
But O
Robespierre O
and O
the O
Committee O
are O
afraid O
that O
the O
popularity O
of O
Danton O
will O
lead O
to O
them O
being O
overthrown, O
and O
put O
Danton O
and O
his O
supporters O
on O
trial O
for O
being O
traitors. O
This O
was O
the O
first O
French O
language O
film O
made O
by O
Andrzej O
Wajda O
after O
he O
had O
arrived O
in O
France O
from O
Poland. O
His O
Polish O
film O
company O
was O
closed O
down O
by O
the O
government O
due O
to O
his O
support O
for O
the O
Solidarity O
trade B-FRANCHISE
union, O
which O
had O
opposed O
the O
Polish O
government O
in O
the O
late O
seventies O
and O
early O
eighties. O
His O
previous O
film O
"Man O
Of O
Iron" O
(1981) O
had O
dealt O
with O
the O
Solidarity O
union O
and O
its O
leader O
Lech O
Walesa, O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
draw O
comparisons O
between O
the O
relationship O
of O
Walesa O
and O
the O
Polish O
leader O
General O
Jaruselski, O
and O
that O
between O
Danton O
and O
Robespierre. O
Danton/Walesa O
are O
the O
voice O
of O
reason O
opposed O
to O
Robespierre/Jaruselski O
who O
continue O
dictatorial O
rule O
despite O
having O
lost O
the O
support O
of O
the O
people O
they O
claim O
to O
represent. O
The O
film O
is O
based O
on O
the O
Polish O
play O
"The O
Danton O
Affair" O
written O
by O
Stanislawa O
Przybyszewska O
in O
the O
1930s, O
and O
on O
its O
release O
the O
film O
was O
criticised O
by O
some O
for O
being O
static O
and O
theatrical. O
But O
what O
the O
film O
does O
is O
to O
concentrate O
on O
the O
behind-the-scenes O
meetings O
of O
the O
Committees O
and O
the O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
in O
the O
National O
Assembly O
and O
the O
courtroom O
rather O
than O
the O
activities O
on O
the O
streets O
of O
Paris. O

Usually O
I'm O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
fan O
of O
the O
bad O
eighties O
& O
early O
nineties O
film O
featuring O
now O
has O
beens...but O
this O
film O
is O
so O
incredibly O
terrible O
that O
it O
was O
a O
real O
endurance O
test O
to O
sit O
through. O
Guys O
dressing O
up O
as O
girls O
has O
been O
done O
to O
death O
- O
but O
never O
so O
pathetically. O
Corey O
Haim's O
performance B-CAST
was O
abysmal O
as O
usual, O
Nicole O
Eggert O
was O
not O
much O
better. O
This O
has O
no O
redeeming O
qualities, O
even O
if O
you O
are O
a O
number O
#1 O
fan O
of O
an O
actor/actress O
in O
this O
piece O
of O
trash O
- O
stay O
away! O

I O
have O
now O
seen O
quite O
a O
few O
films O
by O
Pedro O
Almodóvar, O
but O
this O
would O
have O
to O
be O
the O
most O
disappointing O
so O
far. O
This O
film O
seemed O
to O
lack O
the O
zaniness O
that O
is O
usually O
everywhere O
in O
his O
films, O
and O
the O
story B-STORY
just O
never O
got O
me O
interested. O
Many O
Almodóvar O
regulars O
appear O
in O
this O
film, O
so O
it's O
not O
like O
there O
was O
a O
lack O
of O
on-screen O
talent, O
but O
this O
film O
just O
seemed O
more O
serious O
than O
his O
other O
films. O
If O
there O
was O
a O
comedic B-TONE
edge O
to O
this O
movie, O
I O
certainly O
couldn't O
find O
it, O
and O
it O
made O
for O
one O
surprisingly O
weak O
movie. O

I O
greatly O
enjoyed O
Margaret O
Atwood's O
novel O
'The O
Robber O
Bride', O
and O
I O
was O
thrilled O
to O
see O
there O
was O
a O
movie O
version. O
A O
woman O
frames O
a O
cop O
boyfriend O
for O
her O
own O
murder, B-GENRE
and O
his O
buddy, O
an O
ex-cop O
journalist, O
tries O
to O
clear O
his O
name O
by O
checking O
up O
on O
the O
dead O
woman's O
crazy O
female O
friends. O
It's O
fortunate O
that O
the O
movie O
script B-STORY
fixes O
Ms. O
Atwood's O
clumsy O
plotting O
by O
focusing O
on O
the O
story B-STORY
of O
these O
two O
men, O
victims O
of O
scheming O
women...<br O
/><br O
/>Heh. O
Okay, O
you O
got O
me. O
If O
these O
guys O
are O
mentioned O
in O
the O
book, O
and O
I'm O
pretty O
sure O
they're O
entirely O
made O
up O
for O
the O
movie, O
I'll O
eat O
the O
dust O
cover O
of O
my O
hardback O
copy. O
Apparently, O
the O
three O
main O
female O
characters B-CAST
of O
the O
novel O
aren't O
enough O
to O
carry O
the O
movie. O
Zenia's O
manipulations O
aren't O
interesting O
unless O
we O
see O
them O
happen O
to O
a O
man, O
and O
a O
man's O
life O
is O
screwed O
up. O
Roz, O
Charis, O
and O
Toni O
tell O
their O
stories O
-- O
to O
a O
man. O
Because O
it's O
not O
important O
if O
a O
man O
doesn't O
hear O
them.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
liked O
the O
characters B-CAST
in O
the O
book. O
It O
hurts O
to O
see O
them O
pushed O
off O
to O
the O
side O
for O
a O
man's O
story. B-STORY
I O
normally O
do O
not O
look O
for O
feminist O
angles O
on O
media, O
and O
I O
tried O
to O
enjoy O
the O
movie O
as O
is. O
If O
I O
hadn't O
read O
the O
book, O
I O
might O
have O
enjoyed O
the O
movie O
a O
lot O
more. O
So O
if O
you O
like O
the O
cop O
and O
the O
ex-cop, O
and O
you O
want O
to O
read O
more O
about O
them, O
you're O
out O
of O
luck. O
Read O
the O
novel, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
enjoy O
luscious O
prose O
and O
characterization O
subtly O
layered O
through O
a O
plot. B-CLICHES
It's O
the O
same O
plot: B-CLICHES
the O
movie O
excavated O
it, O
ironed O
it, O
and O
sprinkled O
it O
with O
male O
angst. O
It's O
like O
Zenia's O
revenge B-CLICHES
on O
Margaret O
Atwood. O

this O
movie O

Ingrid O

playing O

Walter O
Matthau's O
faithful B-REMAKES
receptionist O
who O
harbors O
a O
little O
crush O
on O
her O
boss, O
is O
absolutely O
wonderful O
in O
this O
film. O
She O
handles O
the O
witty O
repartee O
in O
the O
script B-STORY
with O
aplomb O
and O
steals O
a O
terrific B-PERFORMANCE
scene O
where O
she O
and O
Goldie O
Hawn O
talk O
in O
a O
record O
booth O
(Ingrid's O
monologue O
is O
a O
front, O
but O
her O
face O
tells O
you O
she O
believes O
in O
it O
with O
all O
her O
heart). O
Matthau O
is O
an O
odd O
choice O
for O
the O
leading O
man O
(he's O
too O
old O
for O
Goldie O
Hawn O
and O
too O
unrefined O
for O
Bergman, O
not O
to O
mention O
too O
unfocused O
to O
be O
a O

but O
I O
liked O
the O
way O
he O
tries O
hard O
to O
please O
Goldie O
and O
stumbles O
around O
trying O
to O
free O
himself O
from O
a O

Hawn O
(who O
won O
a O
Supporting O
Oscar) B-PERFORMANCE
is O
just O
as O
fresh O
and O
bubbly O
as O
she O
is O
today. O
This O
bedroom O
farce O
isn't O
terribly O
sophisticated O
(and O
faintly O
reminds O
one O
of O
"Any O
Wednesday" O
besides), O
but O
it's O
a O
welcome O
relief O
from O
the O
noisy, O
teen-oriented O
comedies O
they O
turn O
out O

(poem) O
) O
is O
actually O
quite O
creepy O
from O
beginning O

It O
is O
similar O
to O
some O
of O
the O
old O
black-and-white B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
movies O
about O
people O
that O
meet O
in O

this O

would O
you? O
Unlike O

entertaingly O
bad O

this O
one O
I O
feel O

I O
just O
can't O
get O
over O
how O

why O

Waaaaaaaaaaay O
better O

use O
the O
word O

That O
word O
was O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
could O
help O
this O

much O
more O

a O
few O

The O
complaints O
are O
valid, O
to O
me O
the O
biggest O
problem O
is O
that O
this O
soap B-GENRE
opera O
is O
too O
aimed O
for O
women. O
I O
am O
okay O
with O
these O
night B-STORY
time O
soaps, O
like O
Grey's O
Anatomy, O
or O
Ugly O
Betty, O
or O
West O
Wing, O
because O
there O
are O
stories O
that O
are O
interesting O
even O
with O
the O
given O
that O
they O
will O
never O
end. O
However, O
when O
the O
idea O
parallels O
the O
daytime O
soaps O
aimed O
at O
just O
putting O
hunky O
men O
(Taye O
Diggs, O
Tim O
Daly, O
and O
Chris O
Lowell) O
into O
sexual O
tension O
and O
romps, O
and O
numerous O
ridiculous B-TONE
difficult O
situations O
in O
a O
so-called O
little O
hospital, O
it O
seems O
like O
General O
Hospital...or O
a O
female O
counterpart O
to O
Baywatch. O
That O
was O
what O
men O
wanted O
and O
they O
had O
it, O
so O
if O
this O
is O
what O
women O
want O
so O
be O
it, O
but O
the O
idea O
that O
this O
is O
a O
high O
brow O
show O
(or O
something O
men O
will O
watch) O
is O
unrealistic. O

This O
movie O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
movies O
that O
I O
have O
seen O
this O
year. O
I O
didn't O
see O
any O
cameos O
in O
the O
movie, O
but O
it O
is O
still O
pretty O
good. B-CAST
It O
is O
similar O
to O
Anchorman O
in O
the O
humor O
department, O
but O
I O
think O
this O
is O
a O
better O
put O
together O
movie. O
It O
actually O
has O
a O
point. O
If O
you O
are O
going O
to O
see O
a O
whole O
bunch O
of O
T&A O
you O
will O
be O
disappointed. O
Just O
a O
well O
put O
together O
movie!!!! O
If O
you O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
for O
the O
day O
or O
you O
need O
a O
lot O
of O
humor, O
you O
will O
find O
this O
to O
be O
a O
really O
good B-CAST
movie. O
I O
definitely O
think O
that O
Ebert O
and O
Roeper's O
review O
of O
this O
movie O
is O
right O
on. O
I O
mean, O
I O
don't O
really O
like O
Ebert O
on O
most O
movies, O
but O
this O
is O
the O
movie O
that O
I O
will O
agree O
about. O
The O
movie O
contains O
a O
good B-CAST
enough O
story B-STORY
that O
it O
is O
actually O
believable B-PERFORMANCE
that O
these O
type O
of O
people O
are O
out O
there. O
There O
is O
definitely O
something O
to O
be O
said O
about O
how O
they O
treat O
virginity O
in O
this O
movie. O
Yea, O
sure, O
you O
get O
laughed O
at O
when O
it O
is O
found O
out O
about, O
but O
it O
still O
suggests O
that O
you O
wait. O
Steve O
did O
a O
wonderful O
job O
of O
portraying O
the O
person O
that O
he O
did O
in O
this O
movie O
and O
yet, O
it O
is O
still O
funny. B-HUMOR

I O
remember O
seeing O
this O
film O
in O
the O
mid O
80's O
thought O
it O
a O
well O
paced O
and O
well O
acted O
piece. O
I O
now O
work O
quite O
often O
in O
Berkeley O
Square O
and O
the O
had O
to O
get O
a O
copy O
of O
DVD O
to O
remind O
myself O
how O
little O
the O
area O
has O
changed, O
although O
my O
office O
is O
newish O
it O
just O
30 O
seconds O
away O
from O
"the O
bank". O
Even O
Jack O
Barclays O
car O
dealership O
is O
still O
there O
selling O
Bentleys O
and O
Rolls O
Royces.<br O
/><br O
/>It's O
look O
like O
the O
DVD O
is O
due O
a O
Region O
2 O
release O
soon. O
The O
region O
1 O
copy O
I O
is O
very O
poor O
quality. O
Let's O
hope O
they've O
cleaned O
it O
up.<br O
/><br O
/>Only O
the O
slightly O
dodgy O
escape B-STORY
sequence O
from O
the O
court O
spoils O
what O
would O
otherwise O
be O
a O
great O
film O
but O
I O
guess O
is O
in O
line O
with O
the O
caper O
tag O
the O

goes O
with. O

Two O
hours O
ago O
I O
was O
watching O
this O
brilliant O
movie O
which O
overwhelmed O
me O
with O
its O
imprisoning O
photography. O
It O
is O
quite O
understandable O
how O
it O
won O
the O
prize O
of O
Best O
Camera B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
in O
Cannes O
2000. O
Close O
ups O
predominated O
it. O
Close O
ups O
of O
walls, O
humans O
and O
of O
many O
other O
things. O
The O
warm O
colored O
lighting B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
(which O
is O
also O
usually O
by O
the O
director) B-DIRECTION
gave O
the O
movie O
a O
warm O
atmosphere. O
Only O
two O
persons O
are O
principally O
to O
be O
seen O
in O
most O
of O
it. O
An O
interesting O
music B-MUSIC
and O
especially O
three O
songs B-MUSIC
or O
themes O
accompanied O
the O
movie O
nearly O
all O
the O
time. O
Each O
one O
of O
these O
themes O
represented O
a O
certain O
atmosphere O
during O
the O
whole O
movie. O
Silence O
and O
slow B-TONE
movements O
characterize O
the O
movie. O
Some O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
were O
extended O
moments O
or O
a O
serious O
of O
close-ups. B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
Not O
only O
Tony O
Leung O
deserves O
a O
prize O
for O
his O
superb O
acting B-CAST
since O
Maggie O
Cheung O
was O
also O
so O
brilliant. O
I O
wonder O
how O
many O
dresses O
she O
was O
wearing O
in O
the O
different O
scenes. B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
The O
story B-STORY
was O
also O
connected O
somehow O
with O
the O
history O
of O
Hong O
Kong O
and O
the O
region O
the O
1960s. O
This O
prevented O
me O
from O
understanding O
some O
details O
of O
the O
it O
especially O
at O
the O
end. O
In O
short B-CAST
I O
would O
recommend O
the O
fans O
of O
artistic O
movies O
to O
watch O
it O
in O
the O
cinema. O

Luckily O
for O
Bill O
Murray O
this O
is O
such O
a O
light-weight O
project O
since O
he O
pretty O
much O
has O
to O
carry O
it. O
Meatballs O
is O
the O
story B-STORY
of O
low-rent O
Camp O
Northstar O
and O
how O
its O
counselors O
deal O
with O
the O
campers O
as O
well O
as O
one O
another. O
Then O
there O
is O
much O
made O
of O
their O
wealthy O
rivals O
from O
across O
the O
lake O
named O
Camp O
Mohawk O
which O
culminates O
in O
a O
two-day O
Olympiad O
competition. O
Above O
it O
all O
is O
Bill O
Murray O
clowning O
around O
and O
making O
a O
pretty O
memorable B-MUSIC
film O
debut.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
film O
is O
sprinkled O
with O
medium-sized O
laughs, O
chuckles, O
and O
more O
than O
a O
few O
guffaws O
along O
the O
way. O
The O
biggest O
laughs O
come O
from O
the O
pranks O
played O
on O
the O
nerdy O
camp O
director. B-DIRECTION
Three O
of O
them O
involve O
the O
counselors O
moving O
his O
bed O
outside O
in O
various O
locations O
while O
he's O
sleeping. O
Morty, O
or O
"Micky" O
as O
everyone O
calls O
him, O
wakes O
up O
along O
the O
side O
of O
a O
road, O
strung O
up O
in O
some O
trees O
several O
feet O
above O
the O
ground, O
and O
finally O
floating O
on O
a O
raft O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
lake! O
There O
are O
also O
some O
funny B-HUMOR
moments O
involving O
the O
counselors O
hitting O
on O
one O
another, O
but O
this O
is O
a O
PG O
rated O
film O
with O
little O
in O
the O
way O
of O
raunchiness.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
film O
takes O
a O
serious O
note O
involving O
a O
shy O
camper O
named O
Rudy O
who O
is O
played O
by O
Chris O
Makepeace. O
Of O
course O
it's O
up O
to O
Murray O
to O
teach O
the O
kid O
how O
to O
open O
up, O
and O
give O
him O
the O
confidence O
he O
needs O
to O
run O
a O
marathon O
during O
the O
Olympiad. O
The O
sentimentality O
of O
Rudy's O
situation O
seems O
tacked O
on O
to O
a O
great O
degree. O
Notice O
how O
when O
Murray O
first O
sees O
the O
kid O
sitting O
alone O
in O
the O
grass O
after O
getting O
off O
the O
bus O
he O
tells O
him, O
"you O
must O
be O
the O
short B-CAST
depressed O
kid O
we O
ordered." O
Makes O
you O
wonder O
if O
that O
line O
was O
really O
in O
the O
script B-STORY
or O
Murray O
was O
just O
ad-libbing O
while O
the O
cameras O
were O
rolling. O
In O
other O
words, O
Murray O
might O
as O
well O
have O
said O
to O
Makepeace, O
"you O
must O
be O
that O
actor B-CAST
we O
hired O
to O
play O
the O
stereotypical O
lonely O
kid O
you O
see O
in O
most O
summer O
camp O
films O
who O
doesn't O
fit O
in." O
But O
before O
it's O
all O
over, O
Murray's O
performance B-CAST
makes O
this O
plot B-CLICHES
device O
more O
than O
bearable. O
He O
really O
seems O
to O
have O
some O
good B-CAST
chemistry O
with O
Makepeace.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
film O
culminates O
with O
the O
games O
between O
the O
two O
rival O
camps. O
Very O
little O
of O
the O
events O
we O
are O
shown O
are O
even O
slightly O
believable, B-PERFORMANCE
but O
"it O
just O
doesn't O
matter". O
This O
is O
a O
pretty O
good B-CAST
film O
on O
many O
levels. O
Don't O
let O
the O
absurd B-HUMOR
5.6 O
rating O
this O
film O
is O
currently O
getting O
scare O
you O
off. O
Murray O
will O
keep O
you O
laughing O
throughout. O
Just O

warned..... O
avoid O
the O

"The O

on O
the O
box. O
Are O
you O
kidding O
me?! O
This O
film O
is O
a O
complete O
drag. O
When O
I'm O
thirsty O
and O
go O
for O
a O
soda O
in O
the O
kitchen, O
I O
usually O
pause O
the O
vcr, O
so O
I O
won't O
miss O
anything. O
Not O
this O
time. O
I O
actually O
found O
myself O
looking O
long O
and O
hard O
in O
the O
fridge, O
just O
so O
I O
wouldn't O
have O
to O
go O
back. O
Why O
the O
hell O
is O
there O
not O
ONE O
sciencefiction-scriptwriter O
out O
there O
who O
has O
the O
vaguest O
clue O
about O
how O
computers O
work? O
It's O
mindboggling. O
One O
of O
the O
premises O
of O
film, O
is O
that O
our O
hero B-CLICHES
(who's O
a O
hacker), O
has O
a O
little O
computerassistant O
to O
help O
him O
(the O
Microsoft O
Office O
paperclip O
finally O
caught O
on O
in O
the O
future). O
When O
he O
loses O
the O
assistant O
in O
the O
movie, O
he's O
helpless O
and O
can't O
get O
into O
any O
computers. O
HE'S O
A O
HACKER! O
It's O
like O
saying, O
that O
you O
can't O
drive O
your O
car, O
if O
you O
don't O
have O
your O
lucky O
"driving-cap" O

even O
go O
into O
the O
lightning-effect O
when O

recieves O

This O
movie O
shows O
a O
clip O
of O
live O
animal O
mutilation O

an O
animal O
getting O
hacked O
by O

happen O
in O
the O

but O
Im O
watching O

The O

Kool O

Carol O
Alt, O

Corey O

comprise O
a O
list O
of O
good B-CAST
actors O
must O
be O
smoking O
something O
I'd O
love O
to O
try O
sometime. O
Where O
to O
begin: O
lousy O
soundtrack, B-MUSIC
hammy O
acting, B-CAST
"action" B-GENRE
in O
places. O
This O
is O
the O
typical O
amateurishly O
written O
hack O
fodder O
that O
washed-up O
has-been O
and O
never-was's O
love O
to O
star O
in. O
I O
actually O
felt O
embarrassed O
for O
the O
"stars" O
in O
this O
"film". O
The O
only O
thespian O
missing O
to O
top O
this O
turd O
was O
Gary O
Coleman, O
who O
if O
he O
would O
have O
been O
in O
the O
movie, O
would O
have O
made O
it O
at O
least O
somewhat O
howlingly O
bad, O
rather O
than O
just O
plain O
bad.<br O
/><br O
/>There O
was O
one O
part O
in O
the O
film O
where O
Carol O
Alt O
screamed, O
"DO O
YOU O
THINK O
I'M O
AN O
IDIOT?!?" O
Yes, O
Carol, O
I O
do, O
your O
agent O
does, O
and O
PLEASE O
for O
the O
love O
of O
all O
that O
is O
decent O
and O
holy... O
GO O
AWAY O
and O
stop O
degrading O
yourself O
like O
this! O
This O
film O
is O
something O
Anna O
Nicole O
Smith O
would O
take O
part O
in.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
would O
tell O
you O
what O
the O
plot B-CLICHES
was, O
but O
that O
would O
be O
one O
more O
sentence O
fragment O
to O
this O
article, O
plus O
my O
mind O
drifted O
many O
times O
during O
the O
movie O
anyway, O
so O
I O
barely O
paid O
attention. O

This O
film O
could O
have O
been O
a O
decent O
re-make, B-REMAKES
and O
gosh O
knows O
it O
tried O
(or O
Ms. O
English O
tried). O
Assembling O
talented O
actors O
together O
with O
a O
successful O
& O
experienced O
writer/director O
should O
be O
a O
formula O
for O
a O
decent O
film. O
But O
Ms. O
English's O
experience O
- O
according O
to O
her O
IMDb O
bio O
- O
is O
exclusively O
limited O
to O
television O
work, O
and O
it O
is O
glaringly O
obvious O
throughout O
this O
film.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
am O
surprised O
that O
none O
of O
the O
reviews O
I O
have O
read O
mention O
what O
I O
found O
most O
unlikeable O
about O
this O
film, O
and O
what O
kept O
it O
from O
reaching O
even O
a O
portion O
of O
its O
potential: O
it O
looked O
and O
felt O
like O
it O
was O
made O
for O
television. O
To O
give O
some O
credit O
to O
Ms. O
English, O
many O
of O
the O
jokes O
that O
simply O
did O
NOT O
work O
on O
a O
movie O
screen O
would O
have O
been O
terrific B-PERFORMANCE
on O
TV O
(and O
maybe O
a O
laugh O
track O
would O
have O
helped). O
So O
much O
of O
the O
camera B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
usage O
and O
the O
lighting B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
would O
have O
played O
out O
fine O
on O
TV O
but O
looked O
awkward O
or O
odd O
on O
a O
big O
screen. O
If O
the O
whole O
film O
had O
been O
chopped O
up O
into O
a O
mini-series O
or O
a O
sit-com, O
I O
think O
it O
could O
have O
worked. O
But O
this O
is O
cinema O
and O
sadly O
Ms. O
English's O
talents O
didn't O
translate. O
I O
cringed O
at O
so O
many O
different O
points O
in O
my O
embarrassment O
for O
the O
actors O
& O
the O
writers O
that O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
came O
out O
of O
the O
theater O
half O
shriveled! O
Meg O

talent?! O
She O
has O
made O
films O
where O
she O
doesn't O
recreate O
her O
stereo-typed O
role O
and O
done O
them O
well... O
but O
not O
here. O
Annette O
Bening O
seemed O
to O
simply O
go O
through O
the O
motions O
- O
such O
a O
great O
talent O
and O
yet O
such O
a O
poor O
performance! B-CAST
I O
enjoyed O
the O
other O
women O
characters B-CAST
but O
they O
were O
more O
caricature O
than O
substance, O
and O
it O
was O
sad O
to O
see. O
What O
worked O
in O
this O
film O
in O
the O
1930s O
doesn't O
translate O
to O
the O
2000s, O
and O
no O
one O
helped O
Ms. O
English O
get O
the O
changes O
& O
updates O
or O
subtleties O
right. O
If O
only O
she O
(as O
writer, O
director B-DIRECTION
AND O
producer) O
had O
reached O
out O
for O
some O
assistance, O
I O
think O
it O
could O
have O
been O
good. B-CAST
But O
it O
was O
not.<br O
/><br O
/>It's O
so O
frustrating O
to O
go O
to O
a O
movie O
that O
has O
good B-CAST
stars O
and O
a O
good B-CAST
writer O
or O
director B-DIRECTION
and O
come O
away O
feeling O
it O
was O
a O
waste O
of O
everyone's O
time O
& O
money! O
This O
New O
Yorker O
cartoon O
I O
saw O
yesterday O
is O
appropriate: O
A O
few O
movie O
execs O
are O
having O
a O
meeting O
& O
the O
caption O
reads: O
"Let's O
remake B-REMAKES
a O
classic B-GENRE
with O
worse O
everything!" O

I O
find O
it O
very O
intriguing O
that O
Lee O
Radziwill, O
Jackie O
Kennedy's O
sister O
and O
the O
cousin O
of O
these O
women, O
would O
encourage O
the O
Maysles' O
to O
make O
"Big O
Edie" O
and O
"Little O
Edie" O
the O
subject O
of O
a O
film. O
They O
certainly O
could O
be O
considered O
the O
"skeletons" O
in O
the O
family B-FRANCHISE
closet. O
The O
extra O
features O
on O
the O
DVD O
include O
several O
contemporary O
fashion O
designers O
crediting O
some O
of O
their O
ideas O
to O
these O
oddball O
women. O
I'd O
say O
that O
anyone O
interested O
in O
fashion O
would O
find O
the O
discussion O
by O
these O
designers O
fascinating. O
(i.e. O
"Are O
they O
nuts? O
Or O
am O
I O
missing O
something?"). O
This O
movie O
is O
hard O
to O
come O
by. O
Netflix O
does O
not O
have O
it. O
Facets O
does, O
though. O

C'mon O
guys O
some O
previous O
reviewers O
have O
nearly O
written O
a O
novel O
commenting O
on O
this O
episode. O
It's O
just O
an O
old O
60's O
TV O
show O
! O
This O
episode O
of O
Star O
Trek O
is O
notable O
because O
of O
the O
most O
serious O
babe O
(Yeoman O
Barrow's) O
ever O
used O
on O
Star O
Trek O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
filmed O
in O
a O
real O
outdoor O
location. O
Unlike O
the O
TNG O
and O
Voyager O
series B-FRANCHISE
which O
were O
totally O
confined O
to O
sound O
stages.<br O
/><br O
/>This O
use O
of O
an O
outdoor O
location O
(and O
babe) O
gives O
proper O
depth O
and O
an O
almost O
film O
like O
quality O
to O
a O
quite O
ordinary O
episode O
of O
this O
now O
dated B-CLICHES
and O
very O
familiar O
show.<br O
/><br O
/>Except O
a O
few O
notable O
exceptions O
i.e O
"The O
city O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
forever" O
, O
"assignment O
Earth" O
and O
"Tomorrow O
is O
Yesterday" O
The O
old O
series B-FRANCHISE
of O
Star O
Trek O
needs O
to O
be O
seriously O
moth-balled O
and O
put O
out O
of O
it's O
boring B-TONE
misery. O
Half O
a O
dozen O
good B-CAST
episodes O
from O
79 O
is O
quite O
a O
poor O
batting O
average.<br O
/><br O
/>This O
is O
typical O
of O
the O
boring B-TONE
stuff O
Gene O
Roddenberry O
produced O
back O
then O
actually, O
contrary O
to O
popular O
belief O
where O
some O
people O
worshiped O
the O
ground O
he O
walked O
on, O
he O
actually O
made O
a O
LOT O
of O
rubbish! O
He O
doesn't O
deserve O
to O
be O
spoken O
of O
in O
the O
same O
breath O
as O
Irwin O
Allen O
for O
example.<br O
/><br O
/>Just O
look O
at O
the O
set O
of O
the O
bridge O
of O
the O
Enterprise O
from O
a O
modern O
point O
of O
view. O
They O
used O
wobbly O
plywood O
for O
the O
floor, O
cafeteria O
chairs O
with O
plastic O
backs O
and O
cheap B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS

above O
the O
instrument O

You O
can O
clearly O
see O
the O
folds O
in O
the O
paper O
! O
Every O
expense O
spared O
or O
what O
! O

I O
just O
watched O
this O
movie O
on O
it's O
premier O
night B-STORY
out O
of O
curiosity O
and O
sheer O
nostalgia. B-REMAKES
I O
liked O
(not O
loved) O
"Mork O
& O
Mindy" O
as O
a O
kid, O
mostly O
for O
Robin O
William's O
zany O
energetic O
performance. B-CAST
This O
movie O
made O
me O
remember O
why. O
Was O
the O
original O
show O
great? O
Not O
really, O
but O
Robin O
certainly O
was. O
Which O
brings O
me O
to O
this O
movie.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised, O
expecting O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
paint O
by O
numbers O
chronological O
retelling B-REMAKES
of O
the O
show O
(which O
in O
a O
way O
it O
was). O
But, O
of O
course, O
the O
real O
focus O
was O
on O
Robin. O
It O
was O
interesting O
to O
see O
Robin's O
journey B-STORY
from O
struggling O
street O
jester O
to O
national O
t.v O
star, O
and O
how O
such O
a O
drastic O
difference O
affected O
him O
and O
his O
long O
suffering O
wife. O
And O
my O
hat O
is O
off O
to O
star O
Chris O
Diamantopoulos O
as O
he O
portrayed O
Mr. O
Williams O
with O
integrity, O
sensitivity, O
and O
heart; O
not O
just O
a O
cute O
impression, O
although O
it O
was O
even O
dead-on. O
(On O
an O
unrelated B-FRANCHISE
note, O
I O
noticed O
that O
Robin's O
struggles O
were O
in O
some O
ways O
similar O
to O
Andy O
Kaufman, O
who O
was O
under-appreciated O
by O
network O
t.v. O
and O
held O
back O
creatively, O
but O
that's O
the O
"Taxi" O
behind O
the O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
biopic.)<br O
/><br O
/>All O
in O
all, O
this O
was O
a O
very O
enjoyable O
flick, O
in O
which O
I O
felt O
I O
got O
to O
know O
a O
little O
more O
of O
the O
man O
behind O
the O
Orkan. O
The O
acting B-CAST
was O
solid O
by O
all- O
never O
melodramatic O
like O
I O
suspected- O
and O
the O
story B-STORY
moved O
along O
well. O
Performances O
that O
were O
particularly O
good B-CAST
were O
by O
those O
who O
played O
Garry O
Marshall O
and O
John O
Belushi O
(the O
scene O
in O
which O
Belushi O
heckles O
Robin O
was O
a O
hoot!). O
Not O
a O
great O
masterpiece O
by O
any O
means O
(I O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
have O
seen O
a O
tad O
more O
about O
Pam O
Dawber), O
but O
definitely O
watchable, O
especially O
for O
those O
Robin O
Williams O
and O
"Mork O
& O
Mindy" O
fans O
out O
there. O
Nanoo, O
nanoo! O

I O
caught O
this O
film O
on O
AZN O
on O
cable. O
It O
sounded O
like O
it O
would O
be O
a O
good B-CAST
film, O
a O
Japanese B-REMAKES
"Green O
Card". O
I O
can't O
say O
I've O
ever O
disliked O
an O
Asian O
film, O
quite O
the O
contrary. O
Some O
of O
the O
most O
incredible O
horror B-GENRE
films O
of O
all O
time O
are O
Japanese B-REMAKES
and O
Korean, O
and O
I O
am O
a O
HUGE O
fan O
of O
John O
Woo's O
Hong O
Kong O
films. O
I O
an O
not O
adverse O
to O
a O
light O
hearted O
films, O
like O
Tampopo O
or O
Chung O
King O
Express O
(two O
of O
my O
favourites), O
so O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
like O
this. O
Well, O
I O
would O
rather O
slit O
my O
wrists O
and O
drink O
my O
own O
blood O
than O
watch O
this O
laborious, O
badly O
acted O
film O
ever O
again.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
think O
the O
director B-DIRECTION
Steven O
Okazaki O
must O
have O
spiked O
the O
water O
with O
Quaalude, O
because O
no O
one O
in O
this O
film O
had O
a O
personality. O
And O
when O
any O
of O
the O
characters B-CAST
DID O
try O
to O
act, O
as O
opposed O
to O
mumbling O
a O
line O
or O
two, O
their O
performance B-CAST
came O
across O
as O
forced B-CLICHES
and O
incredibly O
fake. O
I O
honestly O
did O
not O
think O
that O
anyone O
had O
ever O
acted O
before...the O
ONLY O
person O
who O
sounded O
genuine O
was O
Brenda O
Aoki.. O
I O
find O
it O
amazing O
that O
this O
is O
promoted O
as O
a O
comedy, B-GENRE
because O
I O
didn't O
laugh O
once. O
Even O
MORE O
surprising O
is O
that O
CBS O
morning O
news O
called O
this O
"a O
refreshing O
breath O
of O
comedy". B-GENRE
It O
was O
neither O
refreshing, O
nor O
a O
breath O
of O
comedy. B-GENRE
And O
the O
ending O
was O
very O
predictable, B-CLICHES
the O
previous O
reviewer O
must O
be O
an O
idiot O
to O
think O
such O
things.<br O
/><br O
/>AVOID O
this O
film O
unless O
you O
want O
to O
see O
a O
boring B-TONE
predictable B-CLICHES
plot B-CLICHES
line O
and O
wooden O
acting. B-CAST
I O
actually O
think O
that O
"Spike O
of O
Bensonhurst" O
is O
a O
better O
acted O
film O
than O
this...and O
I O
walked O
out O
half O
way O
through O
that O
film! O

Before O
I O
begin, O
let O
me O
get O
something O
off O

a O
hugely O

became O

me O
point O
out O
the O
fact O
that O

/>Director B-DIRECTION
John O

does O
not O
seem O
interested O
in O

instead O
focusing O
solely O
on O
action B-GENRE
scenes, B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
which O
the O

has O
plenty O
of. O
But O
that O
is O
the O

nothing O

the O
conflict B-STORY
after O
a O
chance O
meeting.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
agree O
with O
the O
reviewer O
from O
Paris. O
The O
film O
substitutes O
a O
convoluted, O
semi-historical O
conflict B-STORY
for O
a O
plot, B-CLICHES
without O
giving O
the O
audience O
a O
single O
reason O
to O
care O
about O
the O
characters B-CAST
or O
their O
causes. O
The O
sudden O
time O
shifting O
doesn't O
help O
matters O
as O
it O
appears O
completely O
unwarranted O
and O
pointless. O
Normally O
I O
don't O
mind O
dark B-HUMOR
movies, O
but O
the O
absence O
of O
light, O
the O
bone-jarringly O
shaky O
camera B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
footage, O
and O
the O
generally O
bad O
film-making O
techniques O
really O
make O
this O
a O
tough O
film O
to O
watch O
and O
stay O
interested O
in. O
I O
also O
agree O
with O
the O
viewer O
from O
Georgia O
that O
this O
film O
"has O
a O
chaotic O
editing B-DIRECTION
style O
and O
claustrophobic O
cinematography", B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
but O
I O
don't O
think O
that O
helps O
the O
movie. O
The O
backdrop O
to O
the O
film O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
potent O
events O
of O
the O
20th O
Century, O
and O
I O
don't O
believe O
you O
can O
do O
it O
any O
justice O
by O
editing B-DIRECTION
it O
as O
if O
it O
were O
a O
Michael O
Bay O
film. O
The O
overly O
melodramatic O
moments O
don't O
add O
to O
its O
watchability.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
actors O
are O
all O
suitably O
melancholy. O
Zhang O
Ziyi O
once O
again O
shows O
that O
she O
has O
an O
exceptionally O
limited O
acting B-CAST
range O
as O
she O
spends O
the O
entire O
movie O
doing O
what O
she O
seems O
to O
do O
best O
in O
all O
her O
films, O
brooding B-TONE
and O
looking O
generally O
annoyed. O
However, O
at O
least O
she O
adds O
some O
variety O
to O
this O
role O
by O
chainsmoking O
and O
engaging O
in O
the O
worst O
love-making O
scene O
since O
Michael O
Biehn O
and O
Linda O
Hamilton O
in O
The O
Terminator.<br O
/><br O
/>All O
in O
all, O
a O
very O
disappointing O
film, O
especially O
seeing O
as O
how O
it O
comes O
from O
the O
director B-DIRECTION
of O
Suzhou O
He. O

After O
hearing O
about O
George O
Orwell's O
prophetic O
masterpiece O
for O
all O
of O
my O
life, O
I'm O
now O
37, O
but O
never O
having O
read O
the O
book, O
I O
am O
totally O
confused O
as O
to O
what O
I've O
just O
seen.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
am O
very O
familiar O
with O
the O
concepts O
covered O
in O
the O
novel, O
as O
i'm O
sure O
most O
are, O
but O
only O
through O
hearsay O
and O
quotes. O
Without O
this O
limited O
knowledge O
this O
film O
would O
have O
been O
a O
complete O
mystery, B-STORY
and O
even O
with O
it O
I'm O
still O
no O
more O
educated O
about O
the O
story B-STORY
of O
1984 O
than O
I O
was O
before O
I O
watched O
it.<br O
/><br O
/>On O
the O
plus O
side...<br O
/><br O
/>The O
cinematography B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
is O
amazing, O
Hurt O
& O
Burton O
deliver O
fine O
performances O
and O
the O
overall O
feel O
of O
the O
movie O
is O
wonderfully O
grim O
and O
desolate. O
The O
prostitute O
scene O
was O
a O
fantastically O
dark B-HUMOR
piece O
of O
film O
making.<br O
/><br O
/>Now O
for O
the O
down O
sides, O
and O
there O
are O
plenty...<br O
/><br O
/>There O
is O
a O
war B-GENRE
going O
on, O
(at O
least O
as O
far O
as O
the O
propaganda B-STORY
is O
concerned), O
but O
why O
& O
with O
who? O
Nothing O
is O
explained. O
There O
are O
a O
couple O
of O
names O
bandied O
about O
(Eurasia O
etc), O
but O
they O
mean O
nothing O
without O
explanation.<br O
/><br O
/>Who O
is O
Winston? O
what O
does O
he O
do? O
where O
does O
he O
come O
from? O
where O
does O
he O
work? O
why O
is O
he O
changing O
news O
reports? O
why O
isn't O
he O
on O
the O
front O
line? O
Why O
doesn't O
he O
eat O
the O
food O
in O
the O
canteen? O
What O
is O
that O
drink O
he's O
drinking O
through O
the O
entire O
film? O
Why O
is O
he O
so O
weak O
& O
ill? O
Why O
isn't O
he O
brainwashed O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
them? O
What's O
the O
deal O
with O
his O
mother O
& O
sister? O
What O
happened O
to O
his O
father? O
A O
little O
back O
story B-STORY
would O
have O
been O
nice, O
no O
scrub O
that, O
essential O
for O
those O
like O
myself O
that O
haven't O
read O
the O
book. O
Without O
it, O
this O
is O
just O
a O
confusing O
and O
hard O
to O
follow O
art-house O
movie O
that O
constantly O
keeps O
you O
guessing O
at O
what O
is O
actually O
going O
on.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
soundtrack B-MUSIC
was O
dis-jointed O
and O
badly O
edited O
and O
the O
constant B-MUSIC
chatter O
from O
the O
Big O
Brother O
screens O
swamps O
the O
dialogue O
in O
places O
making O
it O
even O
harder O
to O
work O
out O
whats O
going O
on. O
I O
accept O
that O
this O
may O
have O
been O
an O
artistic O
choice O
but O
it's O
very O
annoying O
all O
the O
same.<br O
/><br O
/>Also, O
I O
know O
this O
has O
been O
mentioned O
before, O
but O
why O
all O
the O
nudity? O
It O
just O
seemed O
totally O
gratuitous O
and O
felt O
like O
it O
had O
been O
thrown O
in O
there O
to O
make O
up O
for O
the O
lack O
of O
any O
plot B-CLICHES
coverage.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
personally O
can't O
abide O
the O
way O
Hollywood O
feels O
it O
has O
to O
explain O
story B-STORY
lines O
word O
for O
word O
these O
days. O
We O
are O
not O
all O
brainwashed O
simpletons, O
but O
this O
is O
a O
few O
steps O
too O
far O
the O
other O
way. O
I O
can O
only O
imagine O
that O
it O
totally O
relies O
on O
the O
fact O
that O
you've O
read O
the O
book O
because O
if O
this O
film O
really O
is O
the O
'literal O
translation' O
that O
I've O
seen O
many O
people O
say, O
I O
would O
find O
it O
very O
hard O
to O
understand O
why O
1984 O
is O
hailed O
as O
the O
classic B-GENRE
it O
is.<br O
/><br O
/>There's O
no O
denying O
that O
it O
was O
light O
years O
ahead O
of O
it's O
time O
and O
has O
pretty O
much O
predicted O
every O
change O
in O
our O
society O
to O
date, O
(maybe O
this O
has O
been O
a O
sort O
of O
bible O
to O
the O
powers O
that O
be?), O
but O
many O
sci-fi B-GENRE
novelists O
have O
done O
the O
same O
without O
leaving O
gaping O
holes B-STORY
in O
the O
storyline.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
guess O
I O
have O
to O
do O
what O
I O
should O
have O
done O
from O
the O
start O
and O
buy O
a O
copy O
of O
the O
book O
if O
i'm O
to O
make O
any O
sense O
out O
of O
this.<br O
/><br O
/>All O
in O
all, O
very O
disappointed O
in O
something O
I've O
waited O
for O
years O
to O
watch. O

This O
cute O
animated O
short B-CAST
features O
two O
comic B-HUMOR
icons O
- O
Betty O
Boop O
and O
Henry.<br O
/><br O
/>Henry O
is O
the O
bald, O
slightly O
portly O
boy O
from O
the O
comics O
who O
never O
speaks.<br O
/><br O
/>Well O
here O
he O
does O
speak!<br O
/><br O
/>He O
wants O
to O
get O
a O
puppy O
from O
Betty O
Boop's O
pet O
store, O
and O
when O
he O
is O
left O
to O
mind O
the O
store O
- O
some O
hilarious B-TONE
hijinks O
ensue.<br O
/><br O
/>Betty O
sings O
a O
song O
about O
pets, O
Henry O
gets O
in O
a O
battle O
with O
birds O
and O
a O
monkey, O
but O
everything O
works O
out O
in O
the O
end. O

I O
just O
got O
back O
from O
this O
free O
screening, O
and O
this O
"Osama O
Witch O
Project" O
is O
the O
hands-down O
worst O
film O
I've O
seen O
this O
year, O
worse O
than O
even O
"Catwoman" O
- O
which O
had O
the O
decency O
to O
at O
least O
pass O
itself O
off O
as O
fiction.<br O
/><br O
/>In O
"September O
Tapes," O
a O
"film O
crew" O
of O
"documentary O
journalists" O
heads O
to O
Afghanistan O
- O
despite O
being O
thoroughly O
unprepared O
for O
the O
trip, O
the O
conditions O
and, O
oh O
yeah, O
the O
psychotic O
and O
ridiculous B-TONE
vendetta O
of O
their O
filmmaker O
leader O
to O
avenge O
his O
wife's O
death O
on O
Sept. O
11 O
- O
to O
track O
down O
Osama O
bin O
Laden.<br O
/><br O
/>They O
"made" O
eight O
tapes O
on O
their O
journey, B-STORY
which O
now O
"document" O
their O
travels O
and, O
of O
course, O
their O
attempts O
to O
kill O
the O
terrorist O
leader. O
(The O
eight O
tapes, O
thankfully, O
all O
end O
at O
points O
significant O
in O
the O
narrative, B-STORY
which O
is O
convenient O
for O
a O
"documentary.")<br O
/><br O
/>The O
psychotic, O
idiotic O
protagonist O
- O
who O
is O
given O
to O
long, O
significant O
speeches O
that O
he O
probably O
learned O
watching O
"MacGyver" O
- O
cares O
nothing O
for O
his O
own O
life O
or O
the O
life O
of O
his O
innocent O
crew O
as O
he O
gets O
them O
further O
and O
further O
into O
danger O
through O
a O
series B-FRANCHISE
of O
completely O
dumb O
mishaps. O
I O
don't O
know O
why O
he O
didn't O
just O
wear O
a O
sign O
on O
his O
back O
that O
said O
"Shoot O
me."<br O
/><br O
/>The O
crew's O
translator, O
supposedly O
their O
sensible O
voice-of-reason, O
does O
little O
more O
than O
whine O
and O
gets O
baffled O
as O
the O
idiot O
hero B-CLICHES
leads O
them O
into O
doom. O
<br O
/><br O
/>You O
wish O
they'd O
brought O
along O
someone O
on O
their O
trip O
to O
call O
them O
all O
morons.<br O
/><br O
/>Around O
"Tape O
4," O
I O
began O
rooting O
for O
the O
terrorists O
to O
shoot O
the O
film O
crew. O

I O
remember O
seeing O
this O
film O
in O
the O
theater O
in O
1984 O
when O
I O
was O
6 O
years-old O
(you O
do O
the O
math). O
I O
absolutely O
loved O
it. O
I O
was O
Tarzan O
for O
the O
2 O
weeks O
after O
seeing O
it O
(climbing O
the O
furniture, O
jumping O
around O
making O
monkey O
sounds). O
It O
started O
a O
fascination O
with O
Tarzan O
and O
monkeys, O
but O
oddly O
enough O
a O
longer O
lasting O
love O
for O
Christopher O
Lambert O
(keep O
in O
mind O
that O
I O
saw O
Highlander O
very O
shortly O
after O
this). O
1984 O
was O
the O
last O
time O
I O
saw O
that O
film, O
until O
about O
a O
month O
ago. O
It O
happened O
to O
be O
on O
cable O
as O
I O
was O
getting O
ready O
for O
bed O
at O
3:30 O
am O
and O
even O
though O
it O
was O
late O
and O
I O
was O
tired O
and O
I O
had O
to O
be O
at O
work O
at O
9:00 O
am, O
I O
stayed O
up O
to O
watch O
this O
movie O
that O
I O
loved O
as O
a O
kid. O
<br O
/><br O
/>Upon O
viewing O
it O
I O
realized O
that O
it O
was O
not O
that O
great O
of O
a O
film O
and O
even O
odder O
then O
that, O
that O
Andie O
MacDowell's O
voice O
was O
dubbed O
by O
someone O
else. O
Ian O
Holme O
was O
of O
course O
solid O
as O
usual, O
and O
surprisingly O
the O
monkey O
suits O
still O
kind O
of O
held O
up, O
but O
what O
was O
most O
surprising O
was O
how O
good B-CAST
Lambert O
was O
as O
Tarzan. O
He O
was O
great! O
The O
depth O
he O
managed O
to O
capture O
in O
so O
few O
lines, O
his O
primal O
body O
language O
and O
most O
importantly O
his O
ability O
to O
bring O
this O
character O
through O
its O
extremely O
large O
ark, O
were O
just O
amazing.<br O
/><br O
/>As O
I O
stated O
earlier O
I O
am O
Lambert O
fan, O
but O
I'm O
used O
to O
Highlander, O
The O
Hunted O
and O
Fortress. O
In O
this O
film O
he O
was O
really O
quite O
good B-CAST
and O
it O
is O
a O
shame O
that O
he O
never O
got O
a O
chance O
to O
portray O
a O
character O
with O
such O
depth O
again.<br O
/><br O
/>So O
to O
make O
a O
short B-CAST
story B-STORY
way O
too O
long, O
I O
was O
a O
little O
disappointed O
that O
the O
film O
was O
not O
that O
good, B-CAST
but O
I O
was O
glad O
to O
see O
that O
Lambert O
was O
good B-CAST
and O
I O
do O
not O
regret O
staying O
up O
until O
6:00am O
to O
see O
it. O

A O
family B-FRANCHISE
is O
traveling O
through O
the O
mid O
West. O
There's O
widower O
Ben O
(Charles O
Bateman), O
his O
girlfriend O
Nicky O
(Ahna O
Capri) O
and O
Ben's O
little O
daughter O
K.T. O
(Geri O
Reischl). O
Then O
hit O
a O
town O
named O
Hillsboro O
where O
everyone O
acts O
more O
than O
a O
little O
strangely. O
Their O
car O
breaks O
down O
and O
they're O
forced B-CLICHES
to O
stay. O
They O
soon O
find O

just O
figure O

pretty O

The O
acting B-CAST
hampers O
a O

it O
still O
works. O
Martin O
especially O
chews O
the O

in O
his O
role. O
I O
can't O
explain O
exactly O
why O
I O
(sort O

like O
this O
movie O

it O
did O
work O
on O
me. O
It's O
a O
quiet O
kind O
of O
horror B-GENRE
that O
isn't O
made O

Hardly O
a O

this O

Francis O
Ford O
Coppola B-DIRECTION
wrote O
and O
directed O
this O
stunningly O
personal O
story B-STORY
of O
a O
married O
woman's O
flight O
from O
her O
husband--and O
the O
reality O
that O
perhaps O
the O
youthful O
glee O
and O
excitement O
of O
her O
younger O
years O
are O
behind O
her. O
We O
learn O
little O
about O
this O
woman's O
marriage O
except O
that O
she O
has O
been O
feeling O
her O
independence O
slipping O
away O
as O
of O
late; O
she's O
also O
recently O
learned O
she's O
pregnant, O
which O
has O
further O
complicated O
her O
heart O
(she O
doesn't O
want O
to O
be O
a O
complacent O
wifey, O
despite O
the O
maternal O
way O
she O
speaks O
to O
her O
husband O
over O
the O
phone). O
She O
meets O
two O
men O
on O
her O
journey: B-STORY
a O
former O
college O
football O
hero B-CLICHES
who--after O
an O
accident B-STORY
during O
a O
game--has O
been O
left O
with O
permanent O
brain O
damage, O
and O
a O
sexy, O
strutting O
motorcycle O
cop O
who O
has O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
trouble O
in O
his O
own O
life. O
The O
clear, O
clean O
landscapes O
(as O
photographed O
by O
the O
very O
talented O
Wilmer O
Butler) O
are O
astutely O
realized, O
as O
are O
the O
characters. B-CAST
Shirley O
Knight, O
James O
Caan, O
and O
Robert O
Duvall O
each O
deliver O
strong, O
gripping O
performances, O
most O
especially O
since O
these O
are O
not O
very O
likable O
people O
in O
conventional O
terms. O
Some O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
(such O
as O
Knight's O
first O
call O
home O
from O
a O
pay-phone, O
or O
her O
first O
night B-STORY
alone O
with O
Caan O
where O
they O
play O
'Simon O
Says') O
are O
almost O
too O
intimate O
to O
watch. O
Coppola B-DIRECTION
toys O
with O
reality, O
turning O
the O
jagged O
memories O
of O
his O
characters B-CAST
into O
scrapbooks O
we've O
been O
made O
privy O
to. O
He O
allows O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
to O
play O
out, O
yet O
the O
editing B-DIRECTION
is O
quite O
nimble O
and O
the O
film O
is O
never O
allowed O
to O
get O
too O
heavy O
(there O
are O
at O
least O
two O
or O
three O
very O
frisky O
moments). O
It's O
a O
heady O
endeavor--so O
much O
so O
that O
the O
picture O
was O
still O
being O
shown O
at O
festivals O
nearly O
five O
years O
later. O
Some O
may O
shun O
Coppola's O
unapologetic O
twisting O
of O
events O
in O
order O
to O
underline O
the O
finale O
with O
bitter O
irony, O
however O
the O
forcefulness O
and O
drive O
behind O
the O
picture O
nearly O
obliterate O
its O
shortcomings. O
*** O
from O
**** O

This O
movie O
was O
not O
very O
well O
directed. O
they O
almost O
totally O
disregarded O
the O
book.I O
guess O
they O
were O
trying O
2 O
save O
time. O
the O
only O
upside O
2 O
me O
was O
that O
the O
actor B-CAST
who O
played O
finny O
was O
cute. O
Some O
of O
the O
dialog O
between O
the O
main O
characters B-CAST
appeared O
a O
little O
gay O
which O
was O
not O
the O
case O
in O
the O
book. O
Major O
parts O
of O
the O
book O
were O
once O
again O
chopped O
out.You O
lost O
the O
over O
all O
effect O
it O
was O
not O
as O
haunting B-MUSIC
as O
the O
book O
and O
left O
me O
lacking O
severely. O
Also O
the O
strong O
language O
although O
it O
was O
brief O
was O
very O
unnecessary. O
Also O
i O
was O
surprised O
( O
not O
pleasantly) O
by O
a O
new O
character O
that O
was O
no O
where O
in O
the O
book.One O
of O
my O
favorite O
characters B-CAST
(leper) O
was O
poorly O
interpreted O
and O
portrayed. O
He O
seemed O
more O
sinister B-TONE
in O
the O
movie O
than O
the O
real O
leper O
was O
in O
the O
book. O
Over O
all O
disappointing. O

The O
buzz O
for O
this O
film O
has O
always O
been O
about O
the O
fabulous O
graphics O
that O
make O
Kevin O
Bacon O
disappear. O
Sadly, O
they O
stopped O
there. O
They O
should O
have O
continued O
to O
make O
the O
script B-STORY
disappear, O
then O
the O
silly O
set, O
and O
finally O
every O
visible O
element O
of O
this O
film. O
Because, O
there's O
nothing O
else O
there O
to O
show.<br O
/><br O

Thompson O
and O
Andrew O
Marlowe O
are O
listed O
as O
the O
writing B-STORY
credits O
for O
this O
film. O
I O
don't O
really O
think O
they O
exist. O
I O
think O
they O
bought O
this O
script B-STORY
at O
"Scripts-R-Us", O
where O
you O
buy O
a O
standard O
blank O
"Monster O
Movie" O
script B-STORY
and O
just O
fill O
in O
the O
blanks. O
There's O
a O
monster O
stalking O
us. O
Let's O
split B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
up. O
(They O
actually O
"let's O

this O

Not O

Burn O

unsurvivable O
fire. O
Not O
dead O

You O
know, O
the O
standard O
stuff. O
Even O
the O
minimum O
number O
of O
elements O
that O
were O
specific O
to O
an O
invisible O
man O

(IR O

is O
sad O
is O
that O
there O
were O
lots O

this O

treating O
an O

many O
other O
ideas O
were O
touched O
on O
for O
usually O
less O
than O
2 O
seconds O
and O
would O
have O
been O
far O
more O
interesting. O
Had O
there O
been O
any O
desire O
to O
save O
Kevin O
Bacon O
in O
the O
end, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
a O
much O
better O
movie. O
All O
in O
all, O
it O
stunk.<br O

would O
mention O
some O
of O
the O
incredibly O
stupid O
elements O

the O
ending O
of O
the O
movie, O
but O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
do O
any O
spoilers. O
Suffice O
it O
to O
say O
that O
these O
characters B-CAST
are O
so O
stupid O
they O
don't O
think O
about O
pulling O
the O
plug O

than... O

more O
"available," O

All O
ultimately O
works O
out O

not O

Errol O
Flynn's O
dead-on O
impression O
of O
Humphrey O
Bogart O
from O
"Casablanca" O
is O
a O
highlight, O
as O
are O
various O
send-ups O
of O
his O

swashbuckling O
image O
(the O
"jumping" O
scene O
in O
the O

with O
Forrest O

a O
riot). O
It O
is O
Tucker, O
though, O
who O
"tucks" O
the O
movie O
under O
his O
arm, O
lowers O
his O
head O
and O
barrels O
over O
the O

He O
demonstrates O
the O
comic B-HUMOR
flair O
more O
fully O
developed O
twenty O
years O
later O
in O
"F-Troop" O

imparts O
a O
liveliness O

energy O
that O

off O

Robert O
Altman's O
downbeat, O
new-fangled O
western B-FRANCHISE
from O

a O
purely O
technical O
note, O
I O
loved O
the O
camera B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
action B-GENRE
in O
this O
film. O
Subtitles O
were O
totally O
unnecessary, O
even O
though O
my O
French O
is O
"presque O

I O
could O
watch O
it O
again O
without O
the O
annoying O
English O

and O
enjoy O
it O
even O
more. O
This O
was O
a O
polished, O
very O
professionally O
made O

Though O
many O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
seem O
superfluous, O
I O
rate O
it O
nine O
out O
of O
ten. O

I O
don't O
think O
I've O
ever O
gave O
something O
a O
1/10 O
rating, O
but O
this O
one O
easily O
gets O
the O
denomination. O
I O
find O
it O
hard O
just O
to O
sit O
through O
one O
of O
his O
jokes. O
It's O
not O
just O
that O
the O
jokes O
are O
so O
bad, O
but O
combine O
that O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
Carson O
Daily O
has O
zero O
charisma, O
can't O
set O
up O
or O
finish O
a O
punchline, O
and O
you've O
got O
a O
late O

that O
will O
really O
turn O
your O
stomach.<br O
/><br O

have O
watched O
the O
show, O
never O
in O
its O
entirety, O
but O
many O
times O
still. O
It O
just O
creeps O
up O
on O
me O
after O
Conan. O
I O
usually O
watch O
a O
minute O
or O
two O
just O
to O
see O
if O
Carson O

is O

the O
worst O

ever.<br O
/><br O
/>Actually O
if O
you O
ever O
do O
see O
him O
interviewing O
a O
guest, O
it's O
just O
that, O
an O
interview. O
I O
feel O
so O
sorry O
every O
time O
he O
has O
a O
guest O
on O
and O
their O
confused O
smiles O
try O
to O
mask O
their O
body O
language O
that's O
screaming, O
"get O
me O
the O
hell O
away O
from O
this O
freak!" O
I O
do O
recommend O
watching O
the O
show, O
not O
for O
a O
laugh, O
but O
to O
ponder, O
how O
he O
got O
on O
the O
air O
and O
what O
he's O
still O
doing O
there. O
Watch O
as O
much O
as O
you O
can, O
I O
think O
you O
will O
find O
its O
complete O
awkwardness...interesting. O

In O
the O
standard O
view, O
this O
is O
a O
purely O
awful O
movie. O
However, O
it O
rates O
a O
near O
perfect O
score B-MUSIC
on O
the O
unintentional B-HUMOR
comedy B-GENRE
scale. O
I O
can O
think O
of O
few O
actual O
comedies O
that O
make O
me O
laugh O
as O
hard O
as O
I O
did O
watching O
this O

Andy O
Griffith's O
ghost O
dressed O
in O

the O

Which O
was O

that O

in O

by O
a O
society O

nobody O
says O

both O
the O

the O

The O
story B-STORY

very O
trustworthy O

The O
technical O
side O
of O
the O

is O
quite O
fine.. O
even O
the O
directing B-DIRECTION
of O
it. O
The O
main O
problem O
is O
with O
the O
castings, O
that O
turned O
that O
movie O
into O
almost O
another O
local O
and O
regular O
cliché O
with O
a O
great O
lack O
of O
impact O
and O
even O
greater O
lack O
of O
impression. O
Beside O
the O
small O
role O
of O
the O
father, O
Rafael O
(played O
impressively O
by O
Asi O
Dayan), O
all O
other O
actors O
were O
unfortunately O
not O
in O
their O
best. O
The O
role O
of O
the O
elder O
Blind O
girl, O
played O
by O
Taly O
Sharon, O
was O
fresh O
but O
without O
any O
intensity O
as O
the O
leading O
role. O
therefore O
the O
figure O
she O
acted O
had O
become O
mild O
and O
low O
profile. O
There O
were O
moments O
and O
episodes O
that O
looked O
more O
like O
a O
rehearsal O
then O
a O
real O

The O
movie O
itself O
is O
very O
powerful,it's O
about O
the O
hard O
time O
that O
a O
newcomer O
had O
to O
go O
through O
when O
he O
returns O
in O
his O
home-village O
after O
been O
released O
from O
a O
5yo O
prison B-GENRE
time(drugs) O
The O
end O
is O
rather O
sad.... O
Mourikis O
is O
trying O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
his O
part O
and O
he O
handles O
it O
pretty O
well... O
Lambropoulou O
is O
great O
and O
very O
sexy O
in O
a O
strange O
way O
and O
of O
course O
Hatzisavvas O

for O
one O
more O

to O
be O
THE O
stupidest O
film O
I've O
ever O
seen, O
but O
what O
a O
film! O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
fabulous, O
excellent O
and O
impressive. B-PERFORMANCE
It O
was O
funny, B-HUMOR
well-done O

nice O

for O

And O
being O
able O

pull O
it O
off! O
This O
was O
great! O
I'll O
definitely O
watch O
it O
again! O

You O
know O
that O
mouthwash O
commercial O
where O
the O
guy O
has O
a O
mouth O
full O
of O
Listerine O
or O
whatever O
it O
is O
and O
he's O
trying O
really O
hard O
to O
keep O
from O
spitting O
it O
up O
into O
the O
sink? O
That's O
a O
great O
metaphor O
for O
this O
movie. O
I O
kept O
watching, O
even O
though O
it O
was O
really O
difficult. O
But O
keeping O
mouthwash O
in O
your O
mouth O
will O
leave O
you O
with O
a O
minty O
fresh O
feeling. O
This O
movie O
left O
me O
with O
a O
bad O
taste O
in O
my O
mouth. O
I O
should O
have O
spit O
it O
out O
when O
I O
had O
the O
chance.<br O

premise O
is O
corny O
enough O
to O
be O

For O
the O
first O

knew O
how O
to O
fight B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS

up O

some O

to O
get O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
things O
before O
the O
Gargoyles O
run O
amok. O
Unfortunately, O
the O
premise O
is O
completely O
lost O
in O
bad O
dialog O
and O
less O
than O
enthusiastic O
acting B-CAST
on O
the O

of O
the O

The O
best O
acting B-CAST
is O
done O
by O
the O
CG O
Gargoyles.<br O
/><br O
/>In O
the O
end, O
this O
movie O
feels O
like O
a O
poor O

If O
you O
check O
your O
brain O

a O
dreary O

I O
gave O
it O
3 O
out O
of O
10 O
stars. O

I O
can't O
believe O
it O
that O
was O
the O
worst O
movie O
i O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
my O
life. O
i O
laughed O
a O
couple O
of O
times. O
( O
probably O
because O
of O
how O
stupid O
it O
was O
) O
If O
someone O
paid O
me O
to O
see O
that O
movie O
again O
i O
wouldn't. O
the O
plot B-CLICHES
was O
so O
horrible O
, O
it O
made O
no O
sense O
, O
and O
the O
acting B-CAST
was O
so O
bad O
that O
i O
couldn't O
even O
tell O
if O
they O
were O
trying. O
that O
movie O
was O
terrible O
rating: O
F O

This O
is O
one O
of O
a O
rarity O
of O
movies, O
where O
instead O
of O
a O
bowl O
of O
popcorn O
one O
should O
watch O
it O
with O
a O
bottle O
of O
vodka. O
To O
be O
completely O
honest O
we O
are O
a O
group O
of O
people O
who O
actually O
know O
the O
man, O
Mo O
Ogrodnik, O
and O
decided O
to O
drink O
ourselves O
stupid O
to O
this O
film.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
cinematic B-MUSIC
aspect O
of O
Wolfgang O
Something's O
photography O
seems O
to O
have O
left O
out O
both O
close-ups B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
and O
breasts. O
Mo O
and O
Wolfgang's O
collaborative O
effort O
revealed O
the O
passion O
of O
the O
two O
actresses, O
plastic O
peens O
holding O
passion. O
There's O
also O
beetle O
banging. O
As O
Violet O
would O
have O
put O
it: O
"This O
(plastic O
peen) O
goes O
up O
your O
butt". O
The O
rat O
porn O
and O
subsequent O
rat O
smashing O
is O
awesome. O
<br O
/><br O
/>Alright. O
So O
if O
you O
are O
still O
reading, O
let O
us O
explain O
who O
we O
are. O
Mo O
Ogrodnik O
teaches O
at O
NYU O
and O
we O
are O
a O
group O
of O
her O
students, O
who, O
finishing O
a O
film O
class O
with O
her, O
decided O
to O
get O
poop- O
faced O
and O
watch O
here O
directorial O
debut. O
She O
also O
wrote O
Uptown O
Girls. O
I O
can't O
tell O
you O
how O
much O
that's O
been O
hammered O
into O
our O
skulls. O
So O
this O
movie O
is O
quite O
the O
experience. O
At O
the O
very O
bottom O
of O
this O
post O
will O
be O
a O
drinking O
game O
we O
created O
for O
this O
movie. O
<br O
/><br O
/>About O
13 O
minutes O
into O
this O
game, O
none O
of O
us O
could O
see O
straight. O
The O
sheer O
amount O
of O
Dido's O
in O
the O
first O
thirty O
minutes O
created O
enough O
reasons O
to O
drink O
to O
pacify O
an O
elephant.There O
was O
something O
secretly O
pleasurable O
about O
seeing O
two O
underage O
girls O
hit O
on O
a O
Kurt O
Cobain O
lookalike B-REMAKES
with O
absolutely O
no O
context, O
save O
for O
his O
mysterious O
scene O
at O
the O
convenience O
store O
where O
he O
was O
oh-so-naturally O
reading O
a O
local O
newspaper. O
Because O
that's O
what O
we O
all O
do. O
The O
heart-shaped O
glasses O
were O
delightfully O
derivative O
of O
Lolita. O
And O
something O
about O
that O
provocative O
scene O
of O
the O
nude O
chin-up O
boy O
suggests O
the O
director's O
history O
of O
homosexual O
pornographic O
experiments. O
We O
wish O
we O
were O
kidding.<br O
/><br O

intellectual O
contemplation. O
ON O

This O

that O
the O

very O

very O
likely O

Even O
though O
I'm O

The O

are O
my O
ABSOLUTELY O
FAVOURITE O
band! O
I O
never O
had O
the O
chance O
to O
hear O
their O
music B-MUSIC
as O
it O
was O
releases O
but O
have O
loved O
them O
since O
I O
can O
remember.<br O
/><br O
/>It's O
the O
sort O
of O
film O
that O
is O
worth O
trying O
the O
once. O
I O
can O
see O
why O
it O
wasn't O
released O
in O
the O
cinema O
but O
it O
is O
certainly O
a O
great O
film O
to O
put O
on O
the O
TV. O
I O
was O
flicking O
through O
my O
TV O
guide O
and O
happened O
to O
see O
this O
film, O
it O
didn't O
much O
details O
except O
something O
like, O
'John O
Lennon O
and O
Paul O
McCartney O
meet O
after O
The O
Beatles O
have O
broken O
up, O
Jared O
Harris O
Stars'. O
I'd O
never O
heard O
of O
him O
(he O
played O
John) O
or O
Aiden O
Quinn O
who O
played O
Paul. O
However O
they O
are O
certainly O
underestimated O
actors!<br O
/><br O
/>The O
film O
had O
a O
slow B-TONE
start O
but O
as O
it O
developed, O
I O
could O
see O
how O
well O
Quinn O
but O
especially O
Harris O
played O
their O
characters. B-CAST
As O
a O
huge O
fan, O
I O
sort O
of O
know O
what O
the O
real O
Lennon O
and O
McCartney O
are O
like. O
The O
script B-STORY
was O
brilliant O
and O
Harris O
got O
Lennon's O
accent, O
personality O
and O
mannerisms O
spot O
on! O
Quinn O
played O
McCartney O
quite O
well O
but O
sometimes O
went O
into O
his O
Irish O
accent. O
THe O
make-up O
artists O
made O
them O
look O
excellent.<br O
/><br O
/>THIS O
PARAGRAPH O
MAY O
BE O
COUNTED O
AS O
A O
*SPOILER*:<br O
/><br O
/>As O
I O
mentioned O
before, O
it O
got O
off O
to O
a O
slow B-TONE
start O
but O
soon O
developed O
and O
became O
quite O
an O
emotional O
film. O
I O
found O
the O
bit O
in O
the O
park O
a O
total O
waste O
of O
time O
and O
quite O
out O
of O
character O
for O
both O
of O
the O
musicians. O
As O
for O
Lennon's O
rude O
line O
in O
the O
Italian O
restaurant, O
totally O
unnecessary. O
The O
ending O
was O
very O
poignant O
and O
brings O
a O
tear O
to O
my O
eye O
whenever O
I O
watch O
it.<br O
/><br O
/>It O
is O
quite O
different O
from O
the O
other O
biographical B-GENRE
films O
I've O
seen O
where O
it's O
about O
how O
The O
Beatles O
got O
together O
and O
became O
famous, O
and O
those O
never O
really O
did O
the O
characters B-CAST
that O
well. O
E.g. O
'Backbeat'.<br O
/><br O
/>In O
conclusion, O
I O
would O
say, O
if O
you're O
a O
Beatles O
or O
John O
Lennon O
or O
Paul O
McCartney O
fan, O
give O
it O
a O
chance O
you O
may O
have O
pleasent O
surprise. O
At O
only O
about O
95 O
minutes O
long, O
it's O
worth O
waiting O
for O
the O
film O
to O
develop.<br O
/><br O
/>If O
anyone O
does O
know O
whether O
the O
meeting O
of O
1976 O
really O
did O
happen O
please O
send O
it O
to O
the O
'comments O

for O
this O
film, O
I'd O
be O
very O
interested. O

An O
American O
Werewolf O
in O
London O
had O
some O
funny B-HUMOR
parts, O
but O
this O
one O
isn't O
so O
good. B-CAST
The O
computer O
werewolves O
are O
just O
awful: O
the O
perspective O
is O
all O
off, O
it's O
like O
seeing O
them O
through O
a O
distorting O
mirror. O
The O
writers O
step O
on O
the O
throat O
of O
many O
of O
their O
gags. O
American O
boy O
says O
to O
Parisian O
girl, O
"Is O
there O
a O
cafe' O
around O
here?" O
Instead O
of O
just O
leaving O
it O
at O
that, O
they O
have O
to O
have O
the O
girl O
sigh O
and O
respond, O
"This O
is O
Paris." O

Originally O
I O
was O
a O
Tenacious O
D O
fan O
of O
their O
first O
album O
and O
naturally O
listened O
to O
a O
few O
tracks O
off O
The O
P.O.D. O
and O
was O
rather O
disappointed. O
After O
watching O
the O
movie, O
my O
view O
was O
changed. O
The O
movie O
is O
pretty O
funny B-HUMOR
from O
beginning O
to O
the O
end O
and O
found O
my O
self O
engaged O
in O
it O
even O
though O
it O
was O
really O
was O
a O
stupid O
storyline O
because O
of O
the O
attitudes O
that O
KG O
and O
Jaybles O
portray O
in O
the O
movie. O
<br O
/><br O
/>Much O
more O
entertaining O
and O
enjoyable O
than O
movies O
I O
have O
seen O
in O
the O
theaters O
lately. O
ex. O
Saw O
III O
(dull B-TONE
and O
dragging), O
Casino O
Royale O
(way O
to O
homo-erotic) O
which O
in O
prior O
installments O
I O
have O
really O
enjoyed O
<br O
/><br O

you O
enjoyed O
Borat, O
you O
will O
enjoy O
the O
tale O
of O
The O
Greatest O
Band O
on O
Earth O

This O
is O
just O
one O
more O
of O
those O
hideous O
films O
that O
you O
find O
on O
Lifetime O
TV O
which O
portray O
the O
abhorrent O
behavior O
of O
some O
disgusting O
woman O
in O
an O
empathetic O
manner. O
Along O
with O

such O
nasty O
films O
as O
"The O
Burning O
Bed," O
"Enough," O
or O
"Monster," O
this O
film O
takes O
a O
disgusting O
criminal O
and O
attempts O
to O
show O
the O
viewer O
why O
she's O
not O
such O
a O
bad O
person O
after O
all. O
Give O
us O
a O
break! O
Here's O
my O
question O
to O
the O
filmmakers: O
If O
LeTourneau O
were O
a O
man, O
and O
Vili O
were O
a O
12 O
year O
old O
girl, O
would O
you O
have O
made O
a O
picture O
sympathizing O
and O
empathizing O
with O
this O
person? O
Answer: O
Hell O
no.<br O
/><br O
/>Imagine O
switching O
the O
genders O
in O
this O
film, O
and O
then O
you'll O
see O
just O
why O
myself O
and O
others O
here O
consider O
this O
a O
worthless O
piece O
of O
garbage. O
Were O
the O
genders O
switched, O
there O
would O
be O
no O
attempt O
to O
empathize O
with O
the O
criminal. O
Instead, O
we'd O
likely O
be O
treated O
to O
a O
portrayal O
of O
a O
monstrous O
and O
hideous O
man O
preying O
upon O
a O
young O
girl, O
his O
lascivious O
behavior O
landing O
him O
in O
prison, B-GENRE
and O
his O
brainwashed O
victim O
suffering O
from O
Stockholm O
Syndrome. O
The O
only O
reason O
LeTourneau O
does O
not O
receive O
the O
same O
treatment O
in O
this O
film O
is O
by O
virtue O
of O
her O
sex.<br O
/><br O
/>Let's O
call O
a O
spade O
a O
spade. O
LeTourneau O
is O
a O
pedophile. O
Plain O
and O
simple. O
No O
ifs, O
ands O
or O
buts. O
She's O
a O
criminal O
who O
belongs O
in O
prison, B-GENRE
and O
deserves O
our O
derision O
and O
contempt, O
but O
certainly O
not O
our O
pity O
or O
empathy. O

The O
premise O
of O
this O
movie O
was O
decent O
enough, O
but O
with O
sub O
par O
acting, B-CAST
it O
was O
just O
bland O
and O
dull.<br O
/><br O
/>SPOILERS O
The O
film O
does O
not O
work O
because O
of O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
death, O
it O
was O
accidental, O
so O
although O
it O
was O
a O
murder B-GENRE
it O
wasn't O
like O
the O
guy O
set O
out O
to O
do O
it. O
Also O
through O
some O
flashbacks B-CLICHES
there O
is O
a O
secret O
that O
is O
revealed O
that O
sort O
of O
makes O
the O
events O
like O
justice O
to O
a O
degree. O
There O
is O
no O
emotion O
in O
this O
film. O
The O
first O
20 O
minutes O
or O
so O
is O
just O
this O
woman O
calling O
her O
sister, O
and O
hearing O
her O
message. O
It O
was O
dull B-TONE

boring.<br O
/><br O

to O

can't O

it O
enough, O
do O
*NOT* O
get O
this O

from O
it O
as O
well.<br O
/><br O

right, O
perhaps O
I'm O
overexaggerating O
a O
little. O
This O
isn't O
the O
worst O
kids' O

no, O
let O
me O
rephrase O
that. O
This O
isn't O
the O
worst O
movie O
made O
by O

FOR O

somehow O

I've O
been O
meaning O

won't O

get O
out O

this O

Most O
likely O
it O
will O
only O
upset O

There's O
a O
better O
movie, O
"Kiki's O

that O
has O
essentially O
the O
same O
message O

handles O
it O
litely O
instead O
of O
drilling O
it O
into O

the O

like O
it O
too!<br O

In O
1993, O
with O
the O
success O
of O
the O
first O
season O
of O
Batman: O
The O
Animated O
Series, B-FRANCHISE
Warner O
Brothers O
commissioned O
the O
team O
responsible O
for O
the O
hit-show O
with O
producing O
a O
feature-length O
movie, O
originally O
slated O
for O
Direct-To-Video, O
but O
bumped O
up O
to O
theatrical O
status. O
It O
would O
become O
known O
as O
Batman: O
Mask O
of O
the O
Phantasm. O
Ten O
years O
after O
Phantasm, O
we O
have O
had O
an O
additional O
three O

released O
from O

at O
the O
WB, O
Sub-Zero, O

Joker, O
and O
now, O
Mystery B-STORY
of O
the O
Batwoman O
joins O
the O
family.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
plot B-CLICHES
is O
basic O
and O
in O
many O
ways O
similar O
to O
Mask O
of O
the O

the O
mystery B-STORY
of O
the O
Batwoman O
before O
she O
crosses O
the O
line.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
animation O
is O
the O
sleeker, O
futuristic O
style O
that O
was O
utilized O
for O
Batman: O
The O
Animated O
Series' B-FRANCHISE
fifth O
and O
sixth O
seasons O
(AKA O
The O
New O
Batman O

, O
it's O
quite O
nicely O
done, O
and O
just O
as O
sleek O
as O
Return O
of O
the O
Joker's O
animation. O
There O
is O
also O
some O
use O
of O
CGI, B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
but O
it's O
minor O
compared O
to O
the O
overabundance O
of O
it O
in O
Sub-Zero. O
The O
music B-MUSIC
was O
alright. O
Different O
and O
exotic O
and O
similar O
to O
the O
Justice O

score, B-MUSIC
although O
the O
points O
in O
the O
score B-MUSIC
when O
the O
old O

comes O
up O

does O
a O
wonderful O
job O
as O

also O
great O
to O

not O
quite O
reaching O

standard O
set O
by O
Mask O

Phantasm O
ten O
years O

MOTB O
carries O
on O
the O
torch O
quite O
nicely O
for O
the O
animated O
Batman O
films. O
And O
if O
you O
have O
the O
DVD O
and O
are O
a O
hardcore B-GENRE
fan, O
you O
will O
love O
the O
five-minute O
short B-CAST
Chase O
Me. O

I O
think O
this O
movie O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
shocking. O
But O
the O
only O
way O
in O
which O
it O
is O
indeed O
shocking O
is O
how O
shocking O
badly O
it's O
been O
made O
...and O
simply O
is. O
It's O
one-and-a-half O
hour O
of O
torment. O
Even O
more O
so O
for O
the O
viewer O
than O
for O
the O
characters B-CAST
in O
the O
movie O
(the O
five O
girls).<br O
/><br O
/>Sure O
the O
main O
characters B-CAST
get O
their O
bloody O
piece O
in O
a O
bad O
way, O
which O
is O
basically O
fine, O
since O
it's O
a O
horror-movie. O
And O
I O
(usually) O
like O
horror-movies. O
I've O
no O
problem O
with O
violence B-GENRE
in O
these O
type O
of O
movies O
per O
se. O
However O
all O
the O
violence B-GENRE
in O
this O
film O
serves O
no O
end O
whatsoever. O
It's O
no O
spectacle O
other O
than O
that O
it's O
simply O
grotesque. B-TONE
It's O
so O
lame O
it O
even O
gets O
boring, B-TONE
and O
really O
quick O
too.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
worst O
thing O
(if O
the O
above O
wasn't O
bad O
enough O
for O
ya) O
about O
this O
movie O
is O
that O
they've O
tried O
to O
copy O
the O
Blair O
Whitch O
Project, O
by O
filming O
with O
cheap B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
hand-held-cameras. O
But O
(again, O
this O
too) O
serves O
no O
end O
whatsoever. O
In O
the O
"Blair O
Which", O
sure O
enough, O
there's O
an O
explanation, O
namely O
they O
are O
their O
with O
a O
camera B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
looking O
for O
the O
blair O
witch. O
In O
this O
film, O
there's O
no O
other O
explanation O
than: O
"Hey O
ya'll O
we O
wanted O
this O
to O
LOOK O
LIKE O
the O
Blair O
Whitch!!" O
The O
sound O
in O
the O
movie O
is O
also O
something O
to O
get O
depressed O
about. O
The O
girls O
are O
screaming O
so O
hysterically O
that O
many O
a O
time O
you O
can't O
make O
out O
what O
they're O
saying. O
Also, O
no O
effort O
has O
been O
made O
to O
make O
anything O
any O
better, O
sound-wise O
or O
other O
wise.<br O
/><br O
/>Than O
finally, O
there's O
the O
soundtrack, B-MUSIC
which O
is O
just O
as O
bad O
as O
the O
rest, O
and O
varies O
from O
cheap B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
euro-house O
to O
the O
worst O
grungy O
hard-rock...<br O
/><br O
/>My O
advise: O
Don't O
watch O
this O
under O
ANY O
circumstances. O

Why O
can't O
a O
movie O
be O
rated O
a O
zero? O
Or O
even O
a O
negative O
number? O
Some O
movies O
such O
as O
"Plan O
Nine O
From O
Outer O
Space" O
are O
so O
bad O
they're O
fun B-PERFORMANCE
to O
watch. O
THIS O
IS O
NOT O
ONE. O
"The O
Dungeon O
of O
Horror" B-GENRE
might O
be O
the O
worst O
movie O
I've O
ever O
seen O
(some O
of O
anyway. O
I O
HAD O
to O
fast O
forward O
through O
a O
lot O
of O
it!). O
Fortunately O
for O
the O
indiscretions O
of O
my O
youth O
and O
senility O
of O
my O
advancing O
age, O
there O
may O
be O
worse O
movies O
I've O
seen, O
but O
thankfully, O
I O
can't O
remember O
them. O
The O
sets O
appeared O
to O
be O
made O
with O
cardboard O
and O
finished O
with O
cans O
of O
spray O
paint. O
The O
special B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
effects O
looked O
like O
a O
fifth O
grader's O
C+ O
diorama O
set O
in O
a O
shoebox. O
The O
movie O
contained O
unforgivable O
gaffs O
such O
as O
when O
the O
Marquis O
shoots O
and O
kills O
his O
servant. O
He O
then O
immediately O
gets O
into O
a O
scuffle O
with O
his O
escaping O
victim, O
who O
takes O
his O
flintlock O
and O
shoots O
him O
with O
it, O
without O
the O
gun O
having O
been O
reloaded! O
This O
movie O
was O
so O
bad O
my O
DVD O
copy O
only O
had O
name O
credits. O
I O
guess O
no O
company O
or O
studio O
wanted O
to O
be O
incriminated. O
Though O
I O
guess O
when O
you O
film O
in O
your O
garage O
and O
make O
sets O
out O
of O
cardboard O
boxes O
a O
studio O
isn't O
needed. O
This O
movie O
definitely O
ranks O
in O
my O
cellar O
of O
all O
time O
worst O
movies O
with O
such O
horrible O
sacrileges O
as O
"The O
Manipulator", O
the O
worst O
movie O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
with O
an O
actual O
(one O
time) O
Hollywood O
leading O
man-Mickey O
Rooney. O
The O
only O
time O
I O
would O
recommend O
watching O
"The O
Dungeon O
of O
Harrow" O
(or O
"The O
Manipulator" O
for O
that O
matter) O
would O
be O
if O
someone O
were O
to O
pay O
you. O
(I'm O
kind O
of O
cheap) B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
I'd O
have O
to O
have O
$7 O
or O
$8 O
bucks O
for O
"Dungeon" O
and O
at O
least O
ten O
for O
"Manipulator". O
phil-the O
never O
out O
of O
the O
can O
cinematographer O

This O
movie O
took O
me O
by O
surprise. O
The O
opening O
credit O
sequence O
features O
nicely O
done O
animation. O
After O
that, O
we're O
plunged O
into O
a O
semi-cheesy O
production, O
betraying O
its O
low O
budget. O
The O
characters, B-CAST
typical O
American O
teens, O
are O
introduced O
slowly, O
with O
more O
personal O
detail O
than O
is O
usually O
found O
in O
movies O
like O
this. O
By O
the O
time O
the O
shlitz O
hits O
the O
fan, O
we O
know O
each O
one O
of O
the O
characters, B-CAST
and O
either O
like O
or O
hate O
them O
according O
to O
their O
distinct O
personalities. O
It's O
a O
slow B-TONE
uphill O
set-up, O
kind O
of O
like O
the O
ride O
up O
a O
slope O
of O
a O
really O
tall O
roller O
coaster. O
Thankfully, O
once O
the O
action B-GENRE
kicks O
in, O
it's O
full O
blown O
old O
school O
HORROR! B-GENRE
Steve O
Johnson's O
make-up O
effects O
are O
awesome. O
Equal O
in O
quality O
to O
much O
bigger O
budgeted O
films. O
And O
the O
scares O
are O
jolting. O
Kevin O
Tenney O
delivers O
his O
best O
movie O
ever, O
with O
heart-stopping O
surprises O
and O
creepy O
suspenseful O
set-ups. O
The O
tongue-in-cheek, O
sometimes O
cheesy, B-HUMOR
humor O
marks O
this O
film O
as O
pure O
80s O
horror, B-GENRE
as O
opposed O
to O
the O
sullen O
tone O
of O
earlier O
genre O
fare O
like O
"Night B-STORY
of O
the O
Living O
Dead" O
or O
"Hills O
Have O
Eyes." O
But O
for O
true O
horror B-GENRE
fans, O
this O
one O
is O
worth O
checking O
out. O
Play O
it O
as O
the O
first O
entry O
on O
a O
double O
bill O
with O
the O
1999 O
remake B-REMAKES
of O
"House O
on O
the O
Haunted B-GENRE
Hill." O
The O
set-up O
and O
character O
dynamics O
are O
so O
similar O
that O
you O
really O
have O
to O
wonder O
what O
film O
they O
were O
actually O
remaking? O

Though O
I'd O
heard O
that O
"Cama O
de O
Gato" O
was O
the O
worst O
Brazilian O
movie O
of O
the O
decade, O
I O
watched O
it O
giving O
it O
a O
chance; O
after O
all, O
first-time O
director/producer/writer O
Alexandre O
Stockler O
managed O
to O
make O
his O
debut O
feature O
(shot O
in O
video) O
for O
just O
US$ O
4,000 O
and O
-- O
though O
it O
looks O
even O
cheaper O
-- O
I O
can't O
begin O
to O
imagine O
all O
he O
went O
through O
to O
finally O
get O
it O
exhibited O
in O
theaters O
with O
no O
big O
sponsors O
or O
production O
companies O
behind O
it O
(then O
as O
I O
watched O
it O
I O
realized O
why). O
But O
whatever O
chances O
you're O
ready O
to O
give O
to O
"Cama O
de O
Gato", O
they O
shrink O
to O
zero O
within O
10 O
minutes: O
it's O
an O
unbelievably O
preposterous, O
verbose, O
ideologically O
fanatical O
and O
technically O
catastrophic O
attempt O
to O
portray O
Brazilian O
upper-middle O
class O
youth O
as O
a O
bunch O
of O
spoiled O
neo-Nazis O
hooked O
on O
bad O
sex, O
drugs O
and O
violence B-GENRE
(and O
they're O
made O
to O
look O
like O
closeted O
gays O
too), O
made O
with O
no O
visible O
trace O
of O
talent, O
imagination, O
expertise O
or O
notion O
of O
structure. O
Visually O
and O
aurally, O
it O
recalls O
the O
worst O
amateur B-CLICHES
stuff O
you O
can O
find O
on O
YouTube O
-- O
only O
here O
it O
lasts O
NINETY O
TWO O
(count'em) O
minutes O
of O
unrelenting O
hysteria O
and O
clumsiness, O
and O
it's O
not O
even O
funny-bad.<br O

all O

the O

heavily O

<br O

of O
giving O

a O
minimum O

-- O

The O

some O
of O
the O
most O
stupefyingly O
banal O
verbosity O
ever; O
the O

hatred O

what O

All O
you O

Here, O
he's O
told O

graphic B-TONE

opens O

ends O
with O
real O

with O
"typical" O
(?) O
middle-class O

"proof" O

what O
he's O
trying O

But O
he O
blatantly O
despises O

selecting O

prove O
that O
Brazilian O

are O
ALL O
present O

future O
fascists O
BECAUSE O
they're O
middle-class O

enjoy O

he O
saying O
all O

Or O
that O

its O
dogmatic O
self-righteousness, O
headache-inducing O
technique B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
and O
mind-bending O
boredom, O
"Cama O

bad O
for O

1,000 O
reasons O
but, O
above O
all, O
it's O
harmful O
in O
a O
very O
insidious O
manner: O
it O
gives O
detractors O
of O

cinema O
a O
powerful O
case O
of O
argument. O
"Cama O

is O
best O
unwatched, O

An O

masterpiece O
from O
the O
creator O
of O
The O
Secret O
of O

and O
The O
Land O
Before O
Time, O
this O
was O
a O
very O
touching O
bittersweet B-TONE
cartoon. O
I O
remember O
this O
very O
well O
from O
my O
childhood, O
it O
was O
funny B-HUMOR
and O
sad O
and O
very O
beautiful. O
Well O
it O
starts O
out O
a O
bit O
dark, B-HUMOR
a O
dog O
who O
escaped O
the O
pound, O

gets O
killed O
by O
an O
old O

ends O
up O
in O

it O
becomes O
sweet O
when O

befriends O
an O
orphaned O
girl O
who O
can O
talk O
to O

Some O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
were O
a O
bit O
scary O
contrary O
to O
other O
cartoons, O
like O
the O
dream O
sequence O
of O
Charlie, O
but O
everything O
else O
was O
okay,and O

very O
important O

special B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
message, O
gotta O
love O

This O
movie O
was O
a O
failure O
as O
a O
comedy B-GENRE
and O
a O
film O
in O
general. O
It O
was O
a O
very O
slow B-TONE
paced O
movie O
that O
seemed O
to O
be O
trying O
to O
convey O
a O
message, O
but O
the O
message O
was O
a O
cliché, O
hopeless O
mess O
to O
begin O
with. O
This O
movie O
falls O
on O
shameless O
environmental O
point, O
even O
making O
a O
self-righteous O
point O
of O
destroying O
an O
SUV O
and O
promoting O
Animal O
Planet.<br O
/><br O
/>In O
sitting O
through O
this, O
I O
couldn't O
help O
but O
notice O
that O
Steve O
Carell O
got O
no O
more O
than O
a O
single O
truly O
funny B-HUMOR
line. O
The O
only O
thing O
that O
could O
hypothetically O
mark O
this O
as O
a O
comedy B-GENRE
is O
the O
pitiful O
attempt O
to O
give O
comic B-HUMOR
relief O
lines O
to O
Wanda O
Sykes. O
Her O
character O
gets O
frequent, O
cringe-worthy B-HUMOR
lines O
where O
they O
absolutely O
do O
not O
fit.<br O
/><br O
/>Far O
from O
the O
brilliance O
of O
Bruce O
Almighty, O
Evan O
Almighty O
blows O
its O
whole O
record-breaking O
budget O
on O
special B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
effect O
plot B-CLICHES
devices O
that O
turn O
out O
to O
barely O
advance O
the O
plot. B-CLICHES
The O
movie O
spends O
the O
first O
half O
building O
up O
to O
the O
construction O
of O
Evan's O
ark, O
but O
by O
the O
end, O
we O
learn O
that O
the O
ark O
was O
completely O
meaningless, O
and O
the O
whole O
plot B-CLICHES
was O
a O
just O
a O
vessel O
for O
the O
stupid O
gags O
and O
even O
stupider O
messages. O
The O
movie O
concludes O
when O
we O
learn O
that O
the O
whole O
ark, O
flood, O
and O
animal O
gathering O
was O
just O
a O
weak O
political B-GENRE
statement O
by O
none O
other O
than O
God. O
Yes, O
God O
was O
trying O
to O
influence O
politics. O

It O
is O
so O
gratifying O
to O
see O
one O
great O
piece O
of O
art B-GENRE
converted O
into O
another O
without O
distortion O
or O
contrivance. O
I O
had O
no O
guess O
as O
to O
how O
such O
an O
extraordinary O
piece O
of O
literature O
could O
be O
recreated B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
as O
a O
film O
worth O
seeing. O
If O
you O
loved O
Bulgakov's O
book O
you O
would O
be, O
understandably, O
afraid O
of O
seeing O
some O
misguided O
interpretation O
done O
more O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
an O
art-film O
project O
than O
for O
actually O
bringing O
the O
story's O
deeper O
meaning O
to O
the O
screen. O
There O
are O
a O
couple O
examples O
of O
this O
with O
the O
Master O
and O
Margarita. O
As O
complex O
and O
far-fetched O
as O
the O
story B-STORY
is, O
the O
movie O
leaves O
out O
nothing. O
It O
is O
as O
if O
the O
filmmaker O
read O
Bulgakov's O
work O
the O
same O
way O
an O
orchestral B-MUSIC
conductor O
reads O
a O
score--with O
not O
a O
note O
missed. O
Why O
can't O
we O
find O
such O
talent O
here O
in O
the O
U.S. O
? O
So O
now O
my O
favorite O
book O
and O
movie O
have O
the O
same O
title. O

This O
movie O
is O
very O
violent, O
yet O
exciting O
with O
original O
dialog O
and O
cool B-MUSIC
characters. B-CAST
It O
has O
one O
of O
the O
most O
moving O
stories O
and O
is O
very O
true O

life. O

start O
off O
with O

really O
enjoyed O
this O

as O
a O
child O
but O
as O
I O
got O
older O
I O
realized O
that O
this O

is O
pretty O
cheesy B-HUMOR
and O
not O
very O
good. B-CAST
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
film O
and O
the O
action B-GENRE
is O
very, O
very O
bad. O

The O
day O
has O
finally O
come O
for O
me O
to O
witness O
the O
perpetuation O
of O

fate O
as O

character O

draw O

deeper O
into O

world O
she O
rampaged O
through O
so O
mercilessly O
during O
the O
first O
saga.<br O
/><br O
/>That's O
as O
poetical O
as O
I'll O
get O
when O
talking O
about O
Azumi O
2: O
Death O
or O
Love, O
because O
when O
I O
cringed O
over O
the O
heavy O
sentimentality O
of O
House O

Flying O
Daggers O
and O
complained O
about O
the O
credibility O
of O
Aya O
Ueto O
portraying O
a O
blood-driven O
assassin, O
after O
watching O
Azumi O
2 O
I O
started O
to O
appreciate O
the O
previously O
mentioned O
shortcomings O
more O
than O
ever O
before.<br O
/><br O
/>Not O
only O
does O
the O
determination O
of O
each O

feels O
sluggish O
and O
uninspiring O
but O
also O
many O
important O
elements O
are O
omitted O
from O
the O
entire O
experience. O
In O
Azumi O
1 O
we O
saw O
the O
assassins O
use O
various O
stealth O
tactics O
(which O
is O
their O
number O
one O
priority) O
as O
well O
as O
logic O
to O
make O
easy O
work O
of O
their O
marks O
with O
swift O
executions O
and O
quicker O
abilities O
to O
escape. B-STORY
But O
I O
won't O
hold O
that O
against O
this O
movie O
too O
much O
since O
the O

is O
slightly O
tweaked O
this O
time O
around O

many O
more O
obstacles O
are O
planted O
in O
Azumi's O
way O
to O
prevent O
her O
from O
reaching O
the O
warlord O
and O
displaying O
any O
signs O
of O
charisma. O
By O
the O
way, O
Chiaki O
is O
foolishly O
shelved O
for O
the O
most O
part O

final O
blow O
which O
is O
the O
action, B-GENRE
simply O
disguised O
in O
the O
title O
as O
the O
'Death' O
side O
of O
the O
epic. B-GENRE
In O
the O
first O
half O
of O
the O
film O
we O
see O
the O
debut O
of O
many O
promising O
adversaries O
with O
flashy O
looks O
and O
even O
flashier O
weapons. O
To O
no O
one's O
surprise O
they O
meet O
their O
end O
one O
way O
or O
another O
but O
the O
film O
falls O
short B-CAST
when O
each O
of O
them O
start O
dying O
too O
fast O
and O
too O
easily. O
In O
Azumi O
1, O
the O
young O
assassins O
were O
mostly O
overpowering O
the O
opposition O
with O
quick O
but O
somewhat O
satisfying O
battles O

the O
final O

Azumi O

Bijomaru O
in O
comparison O
to O
the O
fights O
in O
Azumi O

was O
at O

climaxed O
and O
worthwhile. O
Some O
interesting O
effects O
were O
introduced O
but O
they O
were O
unable O
to O
achieve O
innovation O
due O
to O
the O
shortness O
of O
each O
encounter. O
I O
am O
in O
no O

down O
the O
conventional O

their O
quick O
and O
realistic O
battles O

in O
both O
Azumi O

were O
so O
imaginative O

the O
rules O

been O
broken O

a O

I O

my O
neutrality O

unimpressiveness O

I'll O
step O
right O
up O
and O
say O
that O
after O
watching O
Azumi O
2, O
the O
original O
was O
made O
to O
look O
like O
a O
flawless O
masterpiece. O
For O
what O
it's O
worth, O
Azumi O

could O
have O
gone O
straight O
to O

with O
its O
invisibly O

an O
unwavering O

This O
has O
to O
be O
the O

are O
an O

spent O
2 O

supposed O

This O
is O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
Butch O
Cassidy, O
which O
actually O
WAS O
an O
entertaining O
film. O
This O
was O
trite, O
cliche-ridden O
and O
boring. B-TONE
We O
only O
stayed O
because O
we O
were O
convinced O
it O
would O
get O
better. O
It O
didn't.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
last O
10-15 O
minutes O

so O
were O
unintentionally O
hilarious. B-TONE
Heath O

his O

holed O
up O

a O
frontier O
hotel, O
and O

are O
dying O
because O
of O
their O

That's O
not O
funny. B-HUMOR
But O
it O
was O
funny B-HUMOR
when O
they O
walked O
out O
of O
the O
hotel O
with O
the O
armor B-CLICHES
on, O

all O
we O

was O
the O

Knight O
from O

kept O

say O
"I'll O
bite O

off!" O
We O
were O
howling O
with O
laughter, B-HUMOR
as O
were O
several O
other O
warped O
members O
of O
the O

When O
we O
left, O
pretty O
much O
everyone O
was O
talking O
about O
what O
a O
waste O

time O
this O

was.<br O

may O
not O
have O
paid O
cash O
to O
see O
this O
disaster O
(sneak O
preview), O
but O
it O
certainly O
wasn't O
free. O
It O
cost O
me O
2 O
hours O
of O
my O
life O
that O
I O
will O
never O
get O
back. O

A O
very O
ordinary O
made-for-tv O
product, O
"Tyson" O
attempts O
to O
be O
a O
serious O
biopic O
while O
stretching O
the O
moments O
of O
angst O
for O
effect, O
fast O
forwarding O
through O
the O
esoterics O
of O
the O
corrupt O
sport O
of O
boxing, O
and O
muddling O
the O
sensationalistic O
stuff O
which O
is O
the O
only O
thing O
which O
makes O
Tyson O
even O
remotely O
interesting. O
A O
lukewarm O
watch O
at O
best O
which O
more O
likely O
to O
appeal O
to O
the O
general O
public O
than O
to O
boxing O
fans. O

I'm O
sure O
deep O
in O
the O
recesses O
of O
Jack O
Blacks O
mind O
the O
character O
of O
Nacho O
Libre O
is O
absolutely O
hilarious B-TONE
but O
no O
it O
isn't. O
You O
can O
tell O
ol O
Jacks O
having O
a O
whale O
of O
a O
time O
hammin O
it O
up O
playing O
a O
smarmy, O
slimy O
Mexican O
friar O
with O
dreams O
of O
becoming O
a O
wrestler O
but O
this O
movie O
is O
a O
total O
misfire O
in O
just O
about O
every O
single O
department.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
just O
sat O
there O
through O
most O
of O
the O
movie O
thinking O
"Is O
this O
supposed O
to O
be O
funny" B-HUMOR
and O
"This O
is O
the O
guy O
from O
Tenacious O
D O
right?". O
The O
truth O
is O
this O
film O
has O
NOTHING O
to O
offer. O
AT O
ALL! O
It's O
a O
lousy O
script B-STORY
with O
crappy O
characters B-CAST
and O
really O
naff O
acting B-CAST
and O
direction. B-DIRECTION
You'll O
watch O
endless O
moments O
where O
you O
think O
something O
funny B-HUMOR
is O
surely O
about O
to O
happen O
but O
it O
just O
doesn't. O
I O
was O
bored O
stupid O
about O
10 O
minutes O
in O
but O
though O
it O
would O
surely O
pick O
up. O
It O
didn't. O
90 O
minutes O
later O
I'd O
barely O
managed O
to O
stave O
off O
an O
aneurism O
it O
was O
that O
painful.<br O
/><br O
/>It's O
like, O
remember O
years O
ago O
when O
you'd O
see O
anything O
with O
your O
fave O
actor B-CAST
in O
it, O
even O
some O
of O
their O
really O
early O
pap O
from O
before O
they O
were O
famous, O
and O
you'd O
be O
really O
embarrassed O
that O
said O
actor B-CAST
was O
actually O
in O
such O
a O
load O
of O
plop. O
Yeah O
it's O
like O
that.<br O
/><br O
/>I've O
enjoyed O
some O
of O
Jack O
Black's O
earlier O
movies O
like O
Shallow O
Hall O
and O
I'm O
really O
looking O
forward O
to O
seeing O
Pick O
of O
Destiny O
but O
come O
on O
man. O
If O
you O
do O
this O
to O
us O
again O
Jack O
I'm O
gonna O
have O
to O
come O
round O
there O
and O
hammer O
your O
kneecaps O
or O
something. O
At O
the O
least O
give O
you O
a O
serious O
talking O
to.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
know O
it's O
a O
cliché O
but O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
movies O
I've O
ever O
seen O
and O
for O
so O
many O
reasons.... O

I O
haven't O
read O
the O
Anne O
Rice O
novel O
that O
this O
movie O
was O
based O
on, O
but O
who O
knows, O
maybe O
reading O
the O
book O
is O
cheaper O
than O
renting O
QUEEN O
OF O
THE O
DAMNED O
and O
is O
probably O
better O
for O
your O
health. O
It O
isn't O
that O
this O
movie O
is O
necessarily O
bad O
for O
your O
health, O
but O
a O
book O
can O
be O
very O
relaxing O
and O
certainly O
exercises O
the O
active O
part O
of O
your O
brain O
more O
so O
than O
this O
movie. O
You O
can O
count O
the O
number O
of O
pages O
by O
Anne O
Rice O
that O
I've O
read O
on O
one O
hand, O
but O
after O
seeing O
this O
movie O
and O
Interview O
with O
a O
Vampire, O
I O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
she O
writes O
really O
good B-CAST
novels. O
The O
plots O
for O
both O
movies O
hint O
at O
a O
whole O
sea O
of O
deep O
and O
interwoven O
vampire O
history.<br O
/><br O
/>Still, O
Stuart O
Townsend's O
voice-over O
narration O
gets O
a O
heck O
of O
a O
lot O
more O
annoying O
than O
Brad O
Pitt's O
vampire O
narrative B-STORY
ever O
did, O
and O
you O
can O
tell O
that O
QUEEN O
OF O
THE O
DAMNED's O
limited O
production O
resources O
barely O
give O
enough O
flesh O
to O
the O
Anne O
Rice O
storyline. O
While O
Interview O
decided O
to O
go O
with O
lace O
and O
elegance, O
QUEEN O
relies O
on O
low O
budget O
special B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
effects O
that O
try O
really O
hard O
to O
be O
taken O
seriously. O
One O
can O
see O
that O
the O
original O
novel O
had O
potential O
as O
a O
movie O
and O
that O
the O
production O
team O
focused O
its O
attention O
in O
the O
wrong O
places. O
The O
costumes O
and O
rock O
& O
roll O
stage O
could O
have O
been O
replaced O
with O
more O
blood O
and O
an O
eerier O
soundtrack.<br O
/><br O
/>However, O
I'll O
give O
credit O
where O
credit O
is O
due. O
The O
soundtrack B-MUSIC
is O
excellent. O
Korn O
and O
Disturbed O
had O
me O
down O
with O
the O
sickness O
bobbing O
my O
noggin O
like O
Butthead.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
film O
opens O
with O
a O
very O
cool B-MUSIC
Goth-rock O
zoom O
& O
splice O
montage, O
but O
after O
the O
first O
ten O
minutes O
or O
so, O
the O
directing B-DIRECTION
degenerates O
quickly. O
It's O
as O
if O
the O
movie O
was O
so O
long O
that O
the O
director B-DIRECTION
realized O
that O
there O
wasn't O
enough O
time O
and O
enough O
money O
to O
do O
an O
Anne O
Rice O
novel O
justice. O
What O
results O
are O
some O
mediocre B-PERFORMANCE
vampire O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
and O
plenty O
of O
cheesy B-HUMOR
special B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
effects. O
Unfortunately, O
QUEEN O
OF O
THE O
DAMNED O
fails O
to O
do O
the O
genre O
justice O
just O
as O
its O
John O
Carpenter O
counterparts O
fail O
to O
impress. O
Where O
are O
the O
yellow O
contacts? O
Where's O
the O
pale O
blue O

Scene O
after O
scene, O
I O
shook O
my O
head O
reminiscing O
about O
the O
days O
of O
Salem's O
Lot O
and O
Fright O
Night B-STORY
when O
low O
budget O
was O
done O
right.<br O
/><br O
/>There O
are O
redeeming O
qualities O
though O
that O
save O
this O
movie O
from O
being O
garbage. O
Props O
to O
Aaliyah, O
and O
may O
her O
soul O
forever O
rest O
in O
peace. O
She O
might O
have O
become O
a O
renowned O
actress, B-CAST
had O
her O
life O
not O
been O
taken O
from O
us O
so O
prematurely, O
for O
she O
did O
give O
this O
movie O
a O
decent O
performance B-CAST
with O
plenty O
of O
nice O
belly O
dancing. O
Did O
I O
mention O
that O
the O
soundtrack B-MUSIC
was O
good? B-CAST
Let's O
see, O
what O
else O
can O
I O
say? O
It O
wasn't O
too O
long. O
The O
Anne O
Rice O
novel O
could O
have O
easily O
been O
a O
three O
hour O
movie O
if O
an O
ambitious O
director B-DIRECTION
like O
Francis O
Ford O
Coppola B-DIRECTION
got O
his O
hands O
on O
it. O
There O
are O
a O
few O
twists B-STORY
and O
turns O
here O
and O
there O
in O
the O
plot. B-CLICHES
But O
all O
in O
all O
it O
was O
a O

rock O
and O

to O
the O

The O

confusing. O
Worse, O
the O
characterization O
in O
the O
premiere O
episode O
is O
poor. O
Although O
the O

Leonard O
Maltin O
gave O
this O
film O
a O
dreaded O
BOMB O
rating O
in O
his O
1995 O
Movie O

Guide. O
What O
film O
was O
he O
looking O
at? O
Kid O
Vengeance O
or O
God's O
Gun O
are O
bombs. O
This O
film O
is O
a O
delight. O
It O
is O
fantastic. O
It O
is O
literate. O
It O
is O
well O
mounted. O
It O
is O
beautiful O
photographed, O
making O
a O
brilliant O
use O
of O
colors. O
Right O
from O
the O
opening O
scene O
the O
film O
grabs O
your O
attention O
and O
tips O
you O
off O
that O
this O
film O
is O
a O
well-done O
satire B-HUMOR
of O
the O
whole O
Spaghetti O
Western B-FRANCHISE
genre. O
The O
film O
is O
played O
for O
laughs O
from O
the O
beginning O
to O
the O
end O
with O
homages O
to O
Douglas O
Fairbanks, O

and O
the O
famous O
showdown O
in O
the O
Good, B-CAST

Bad, O
and O
the O
Ugly. O
Edd O
Byrnes, O
George O
Hilton, O
and O
Gilbert O
Roland O
work O
brilliantly O
together O
to O
make O
the O
satire B-HUMOR
work. O
It O
is O
too O
bad O
Mr. O
Maltin O
rated O
this O
film O
so O
poorly O
as O
it O
is O
undeserved. O
One O
can O
only O
guess O
as O
to O
his O
reason. O
I O
suspect O
that O
he O
missed O
the O
point O
of O
the O
movie O
entirely O
and O
was O
expecting O
something O
more O
serious O
than O
this O
film O
is O
meant O
to O
be. O
Kudos O
belong O
to O
everyone O
involved O
in O
this O
project. O
This O
film O
is O
a O
little O
gem O
waiting O
to O
be O
discovered O
by O
people O
who O
care O
about O

are O
today's O
equivalent O
to O

Their O
hatred O
of O
all O
that O

good B-CAST
and O

pure O

Their O
daily O

and O
utterly O
insane O
view O

The O

they O
spout O
and O
the O
ridiculous B-TONE

they O
try O
to O
pass O
off O
as O

such O
as O
the O
idea O
of O
"life O
after O
death" O
or O
"god" O
or O
"sin" O
or O
"the O

is O
so O
preposterous O
that O
they O
actually O
seem O
mentally O
ill, O
so O
lost O
are O
they O
in O
their O

Sane O

know O
that O

However, O
The O

I O
hope O
that O
one O

the O
American O

finally O
take O
up O

is O
even O
more O
horrible O
as O
it O
rises O
to O
the O
legal O
definition O
of O
'cult' B-FRANCHISE

due O
to O

The O

out O

But O
in O

lost O
all O

in O
their O

If O
you O
wish O
to O
see O
Shakespeare's O
masterpiece O
in O
its O
entirety, O
I O
suggest O
you O
find O
this O
BBC O
version. O
Indeed O
it O
is O
overlong O
at O
four O
and O
a O
half O
hours O
but O
Jacoby's O
performance B-CAST
as O
Hamlet O
and O
Patrick O
Stewart's O
as O
Claudius O
are O
well O
worth O
the O
effort.<br O
/><br O
/>It O
never O
ceases O
to O
amaze O
me O
how O
clear O
"Hamlet" O
is O
when O
you O
see O
it O
in O
its O
length O
and O
order O
as O
set O
down O
by O
the O
Bard. O
Every O
film O
version O
of O
"Hamlet" O
has O
tinkered O
with O
its O
structure. O
Olivier O
concentrated O
on O
Hamlet's O
indecision, O
Gibson O
on O
his O
passions. O
Jacoby O
is O
able O
to O
pull O
all O
of O
these O
aspects O
of O
Hamlet's O
character O
together O
with O
the O
aid O
of O
Shakespeare's O
full O
script.<br O
/><br O
/>Why O
does O
Hamlet O
not O
kill O
Claudius O
immediately? O
Hamlet O
says O
"I O
am O
very O
proud, O
revengeful, O
ambitious..." O
Hamlet O
is O
extremely O
upset, O
not O
only O
for O
his O
father's O
death O
(and O
suspected O
murder), B-GENRE
or O
his O
mother's O
marriage O
to O
his O
uncle, O
but O
also, O
and O
mostly, O
because O
Claudius O
has O
usurped O
the O
throne O
belonging O
to O
Hamlet. O
He O
is O
furious O
at O
his O
mother O
for O
marrying O
Claudius O
(marriages O
between O
royal O
kin O
is O
not O
unknown; O
done O
for O
political B-GENRE
reasons) O
but O
that O
her O
marriage O
solidified O
Claudius' O
claim O
to O
the O
throne O
before O
he O
could O
return O
from O
Wittenburg O
to O
claim O
it O
for O
himself. O
He O
is, O
therefore, O
impotent O
to O
do O
anything O
about O
it. O
And O
this O
is O
true O
even O
after O
he O
hears O
his O
father's O
ghost O
cry O
vengeance. O
He O
cannot O
simply O
kill O
the O
King O
or O
he O
will O
lose O
the O
throne O
in O
doing O
so. O
He O
must O
"out" O
the O
King's O
secret O
and O
here O
is O
the O
tragedy! O
At O
the O
moment O
Hamlet O
is O
successful O
in O
displaying O
Claudius' O
guilt O
in O
public, O
he O
has O
opportunity O
to O
kill O
him O
and O
does O
not. O
WHY? O
He O
wants O
it O
ALL! O
He O
wants O
revenge, B-CLICHES
the O
throne O
AND O
the O
damnation O
of O
Claudius' O
soul O
in O
hell. O
Hamlet O
OVERREACHES O
himself O
in O
classic B-GENRE
tragic B-STORY
form. O
His O
own O
HUBRIS O
is O
his O
undoing. O
He O
kills O
Polonius O
thinking O
it O
is O
Claudius O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
play O
spirals O
down O
to O
the O
final O
deaths O
of O
Rosencrantz, O
Guildenstern, O
Ophelia, O
Laertes, O
Gertrude, O
Claudius O
and O
Hamlet O
himself. O

The O
Golden O
Door O
is O
the O
story B-STORY
of O
a O
Sicilian O
family's O
journey B-STORY
from O
the O
Old O
World O
(Italy) O
to O
the O
New O

Salvatore, O
a O
middle-aged O
man O
who O
hopes O

persuades O
his O
family B-FRANCHISE

leave O

behind O
in O
Sicily, O
take O
the O
arduous O
journey B-STORY
across O
the O
raging O
seas, O
and O
inhabit O
a O
land O
whose O
rivers O
supposedly O
flow O
with O
milk. O
In O
short, B-CAST
they O
believe O
that O
by O
risking O
everything O
for O
the O
New O
World O
their O
dreams O
of O
prosperity O
will O
be O
fulfilled. O
The O
imagery O
of O
the O
New O
World O
is O
optimistic, O
clever O
and O
highly O
imaginative. O
Silver O
coins O
rain O
from O
heaven O
upon O
Salvatore O
as O
he O
anticipates O
how O
prosperous O
he'll O
be O
in O
the O
New O
World; O
carrots O
and O
onions O
twice O

being O

through O
the O
minds O
of O
those O
who O
anticipate O
what O
the O
New O
World O
will O
yield. O
All O
of O
this O
imagery O
is O
surrealistically O
interwoven O
with O
the O
characters B-CAST
and O
helps O
nicely O
compliment O
the O
gritty B-TONE
realism B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
that O
the O
story B-STORY

The O
contrast O

/><br O

voyage O
to O
the O

almost O

especially O
when O
the O

The O

the O
journey B-STORY
itself O

the O

The O
Old O
World O
is O
depicted O
as O
somewhat O
destitute O

primitive. O
This O
is O
shown O
as O
Salvatore O
scrambles O
together O

I O
thought O
it O
was O
rather O
interesting O
that O
these O
people O
believed O
they O
had O
to O
conform O
to O
a O
certain O
dress O
code O
in O
order O
to O
be O
accepted O
in O
the O

it O

almost O

fit O
a O
particular O
stereotype O
or O
mold O
in O
order O
to O
be O
recognized O
as O
morally O

The O
most O
powerful O
image O
in O
the O

was O
when O
the O

setting O

the O

of O
Liberty O
is O
never O
shown O
through O
the O
fog O
at O
Ellis O
Island, O
but O
is O
remained O
hidden. O
I O
think O
this O
was O
an O
intentional O
directing B-DIRECTION
choice O
that O
seemed O
to O
negate O
the O
purpose O
of O
what O
the O
Statue O
of O
Liberty O
stands O
for: O
"Give O
me O
your O
poor, O
your O
tired, O
your O
hungry" O
seemed O
like O
a O
joke O
in O
regards O
to O
what O
these O
people O
had O
to O
go O
through O
when O
arriving O
at O
the O
New O
World. O
Once O
they O
arrived O
in O
the O
Americas, O
they O
had O
to O
go O
through O
rather O
humiliating O
tests O
(i.e. O
delousing, O
mathematics, O
puzzles, O
etc.) O
in O
order O
to O
prove O
themselves O
as O
fit O
for O
the O
New O
World. O
These O
tests O
completely O
changed O
the O
perspectives O
of O
the O
Sicilian O
people. O
In O
particular, O
Salvatore's O
mother O
had O
the O
most O
difficult O
time O
subjecting O
herself O
to O
the O
rules O
and O
laws O
of O
the O
New O
World, O
feeling O
more O
violated O
than O
treated O
with O
respect. O
Where O
their O
dreams O
once O
provided O
hope O
and O
optimism O
for O
what O
the O
New O
World O
would O
provide, O
the O
reality O
of O
what O
the O
New O
World O
required O
was O
disparaging O
and O
rude. O
Salvatore O
doesn't O
change O
much O
other O
than O
his O
attitude O
towards O
what O
he O
felt O
the O
New O
World O
would O
be O
like O
versus O
what O
the O
New O
World O
actually O
was O
seemed O
disappointing O
to O
him. O
This O
attitude O
was O
shared O
by O
mostly O
everyone O
who O
voyaged O
with O
him. O
Their O
character O
arcs O
deal O
more O
with O
a O
cherished O
dream O
being O
greatly O
upset O
and O
a O
dark B-HUMOR
reality O
that O
had O
to O
be O
accepted.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
film O
seems O
to O
make O
a O
strong O
commentary O
on O
preparing O
oneself O
to O
enter O
a O
heavenly O
and O
civilized O
society. O
Cleanliness, O
marriage O
and O
intelligence O
are O
prerequisites. O
Adhering O
to O
these O
rules O
is O
to O
prevent O
disease, O
immoral O
behavior O
and O
stupidity O
from O
dominating. O
Perhaps O
this O
is O
a O
commentary O
on O
how O
America O
has O
learned O
from O
the O
failings O
of O
other O
nations O
and O
so O
was O
purposefully O
established O
to O
secure O
that O
these O
plagues O
did O
not O
infest O
and O
destruct. O
Though O
the O
rules O
seemed O
rigid, O
they O
were O
there O
to O
protect O
and O
help O
the O
people O
flourish. O

Nifty O
little O

I O
had O
before O
a O
feeling O
of O
mislike O
for O
all O
Russian O
films. O
But, O
after O
seeing O
this O
film O
I O
haven´t. O
This O
is O
a O
unique O
masterpiece O
made O
by O
the O
best O
director B-DIRECTION
ever O
lived O
in O
the O
USSR. O
He O
knows O
the O
art B-GENRE

can O
use O
it O
very O
well. O
If O
you O
find O
this O
movie: O
buy O
or O
copy O

I O
watched O

80's O

it's O
currently O
showing O
on O

(very O
late O

I O
remember O
thinking O
that O
it O
was O
kinda O
cool B-MUSIC
back O
in O
the O
day O
and O
had O
a O
couple O
of O
the O
toys O
too O
but O
watching O
it O
now O
bores O
me O
to O
tears. O
I O
never O
realised O
before O
of O
how O
tedious O
and O
bland O
this O
cartoon O

really O
was. O
It's O
just O
plain O
awful! O
It O
is O
no O

near O
in O
the O
same O
league O
as O
The O
Transformers, O
He-man O
or O

and O
was O
very O
quickly O
forgot O
by O
nearly O
everyone O
once O
it O
stopped O
being O
made. O
I O
only O
watch O
it O
on O
Fox O

because O
Ulysses O

comes O
on O
straight O
after O
it O
(that's O
if O

One O
of O
the O

quite O

The O

in O

out O

If O
you O

rigid O
historical B-GENRE

out O

it, O
this O

actually O

As O
evident O
on O
this O
board, O
the O

doesn't O
pass O

who O
look O

To O
get O

one O
need O
only O
put O
aside O
the O

and O
enjoy O
the O
story B-STORY
as O
if O
it O
were O
a O
work O
of O

I O
know, O
I O
know, O
that's O
hard O
to O
do O
when O
you O
consider O
Custer's O
Last O
Stand O
at O
the O

and O
it's O
prominence O
in O
the O

of O
post O

America. O
So O
I O
guess O
there's O
an O
unresolved O
quandary O
with O
the O
picture, O
no O
matter O
how O
you O
look O
at O

/><br O

a O

to O
take O
in O

though O
for O

two O
hour O

Custer's O
arrival O
at O
West O

is O
probably O
the O
first O
head O

riding O
up O

he O
does O
in O
full O

The O

by O
Sharp O
(Arthur O

putting O

probably O
should O
have O

/><br O
/>Ironically, O
a O
lot O
of O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
in O
this O
military O
film O
play O
for O
comedy, B-GENRE
as O
in O
Custer's O
first O
meeting O
with O
Libby O
Bacon, O
and O
subsequent O
encounters O
that O
include O
tea O
reader O
Callie O
(Hattie O
McDaniel). O
I O
hadn't O
noticed O
it O
before O
in O
other O
films, O
but O
McDaniel O
reminded O
me O
an O
awful O
lot O
of O
another O
favorite O
character O
actor B-CAST
of O
mine O
from O
the O
Forties, O
Mantan O
Moreland. O
So O
much O
so O
that O
in O
one O
scene O
it O
looked O
like O
it O
might O
have O
been O
Moreland O
hamming O
it O
up O
in O
a O
dress. O
With O
that O
in O
mind, O
the O
owl O
scene O
was O
a O
hoot O
too.<br O
/><br O
/>As O
for O
Flynn, B-CAST
it's O
interesting O
to O
note O
that O
a O
year O
earlier, O
he O
portrayed O
J.E.B. O
Stuart O
opposite O
Ronald O
Reagan's O
depiction O
of O
General O
Custer O
in O
"Santa O
Fe O
Trail", O
both O
vying O
for O
the O
attention O
of O
none O
other O
than O
Olivia O
de O
Havilland. O
In O
that O
film, O
Reagan O
put O
none O
of O
the O
arrogance O
and O
flamboyance O
into O
the O
character O
of O
Custer O
that O
history O
remembers, O
while O
in O
Flynn's O
portrayal O
here O
it's O
more O
than O
evident. O
But O
it O
doesn't O
come O
close O
to O
that O
of O
Richard O
Mulligan's O
take O
on O
the O
military O
hero B-CLICHES
in O
1970's O
"Little O
Big O
Man". O
Let's O
just O
say O
that O
one O
was O
a O
bit O
over O
the O
top.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
better O
take O
away O
the O
picture O
had O
for O
me O
was O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
Custer O
persevered O
to O
maintain O
his O
good B-CAST
name O
and O
not O
gamble O
it O
away O
on O
a O
risky O
business O
venture. O
That O
and O
his O
loyalty O
to O
the O
men O
he O
led O
in O
battle O
along O
with O
the O
discipline O
he O
developed O
over O
the O
course O
of O
the O
story. B-STORY
Most O
poignant O
was O
that O
final O
confrontation O
with O
arch O
rival O
Sharp O
just O
before O
riding O
into O
the O
Little O
Big O
Horn, O
in O
which O
he O
declared O
that O
hell O
or O
glory O
was O
entirely O
dependent O
on O
one's O
point O
of O
view. O
Earlier, O
a O
similar O
remark O
might O
have O
given O
us O
the O
best O
insight O
of O
all O
into O
Custer's O
character, O
when O
he O
stated O
- O
"You O
take O
glory O
with O
you O
when O
it's O
your O
time O
to O
go". O

The O
film O
quickly O
gets O
to O
a O
major O
chase O
scene O
with O
ever O
increasing O
destruction. O
The O
first O
really O
bad O
thing O
is O
the O
guy O
hijacking O
Steven O
Seagal O
would O
have O
been O
beaten O
to O
pulp O
by O
Seagal's O
driving, O
but O
that O
probably O
would O
have O
ended O
the O
whole O
premise O
for O
the O
movie.<br O
/><br O
/>It O
seems O
like O
they O
decided O
to O
make O
all O
kinds O
of O
changes O
in O
the O
movie O
plot, B-CLICHES
so O
just O
plan O
to O
enjoy O
the O
action, B-GENRE
and O
do O
not O
expect O
a O
coherent O
plot. B-CLICHES
Turn O
any O
sense O
of O
logic O
you O
may O
have, O
it O
will O
reduce O
your O
chance O
of O
getting O
a O
headache.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
does O
give O
me O
some O
hope O
that O
Steven O
Seagal O
is O
trying O
to O
move O
back O
towards O
the O
type O
of O
characters B-CAST
he O
portrayed O
in O
his O
more O
popular O
movies. O

Interesting O
and O
short B-CAST

some O
of O
the O

/><br O
/>The O
film O
does O
a O
good B-CAST
job O
of O
sparking O
viewers' O
interest O
in O
the O
events O
and O
showing O
some O
of O
the O
concerns O
of O
the O
stakeholders, O
particularly O
of O
the O
NBC O
executives. O
The O
portrayal O
of O
Ovitz O
was O
particularly O
compelling O
and O
interesting, O
I O
thought.<br O
/><br O
/>Still, O
many O
of O
the O
characters B-CAST
were O
only O
very O
briefly O
limned O
or O
touched O
upon, O
and O
some O
of O
the O
acting B-CAST
seemed O
perfunctory. O
Nevertheless, O
an O
interesting O
story. B-STORY

For O

an O

such O

prefer O

No O

can O

I O
wasn't O
warned O

I O
have O
read O
the O
reviews O
(both O
user O

like O
most O
of O
us O

that O
this O

left O

because O
it O
pretends O
to O
be O
real O
(who O
cares...gimmicks O
are O

or O
because O
the O

are O
so O
lame O
(is O
this O
an O
unusual O
event O

or O
even O
because O
the O

is O
so O
bad O
(and O
I O
am O
being O
polite O
here). O
What O
really O
got O
me O

is O
that O
the O

is O
not O
only O
a O
rip O
off O
of O
BWP, O

also O
a O

I O
do O

it O

did O

so O

a O
Vacation. O
It O
is O
a O
great O
show, O
I O
just O
wish O
it O
wasn't O
on O
so O
late O
at O
night. B-STORY
It's O
on O
at O
12:30 O
AM. O
As O
a O
working O
person O
it O
makes O
it O
hard O
to O
watch O
all O
the O
time.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
read O
some O
comments. O
I O
did O
not O
agree O
with O
the O
late O
one O
about O
not O
growing O
up O
in O
the O
60's O
and O
not O
believing O
that O
this O
stuff O
can O
happen.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
grew O
up O
in O
the O
60's. O
I'm O
Hispanic O
and O
I O
had O
a O
"White" O
boyfriend O
plus O
we O
had O
black B-HUMOR
friends O
in O
High O
School. O
I O
believe O
people O
get O
along O
because O
of O
their O
interests O
and O
personalities O
and O
it O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
being O
a O
certain O
race O
or O
color.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
can't O
wait O
till O
the O
show O
goes O
on O
DVD O
so O
I O
can O
buy O
it. O
This O
way O
I O
can O
see O
it O
from O
the O
beginning. O

This O
film O
is O
well O
cast, B-CAST
often O
silly O
and O
always O
funny. B-HUMOR
Lemmon O
and O
Matthau O
work O
their O
tag O
team O
magic O
to O
perfection. O
Brent O
Spiner B-CAST
is O
just O
a O
riot O
as O
the O
egotistical O
tyrant O
of O
a O
cruise O
director. B-DIRECTION
From O
the O
first O
"hare O
krishna" O
to O
the O
last O
"you O
ought O
pay O
him O
fifty O
bucks O
for O
calling O
you O
two O
studs", O
I O
thought O
this O
was O
a O
totally O
entertaining O
fun B-PERFORMANCE
comedy B-GENRE

I O
have O
just O
given O
a O
10 O
for O
Thieves O
Highway, O
I O
mention O
this O
for O
two O
reasons O
one O
to O
prove O
I'm O
not O
a O
git O
who O
only O
gives O
bad O
reviews O
but O
2 O
because O
the O
theme B-MUSIC
of O
the O
film O
has O
the O
same O
thread O
namely O
the O
falling O
in O
love O
with O
a O
woman O
of O
the O
night.<br O
/><br O
/>We O
all O
know O
pretty O
Woman O
is O
a O
chick O
flick O
but O
you O
can't O
avoid O
them O
all, O
they'll O
eventually O
get O
you. O
Pretty O
Woman O
for O
me O
does O
two O
things, O
two O
terrible O
horrible O
ghastly O
things, O
firstly O
it O
portrays O
prostitution O
as O
a O
career O
more O
akin O
to O
that O
of O
a O
dancer, O
you O
know O
with O
absolutely O
great O
friends, O
leg O
warmers O
lots O
of O
giggling, O
borrowing O
each O
others O
make O
up. O
You O
see O
in O
the O
reality O
of O
Pretty O
Woman O
the O
prostitute O
and O
this O
is O
a O
street O
walker O
Prostitute O
we're O
talking O
about O
here, O
has O
a O
great O
life, O
she's O
healthy O
happy O
with O
only O
the O
occasional O
whimper O
to O
explain O
her O
predicament. O
My O
feeling O
is O
this O
'happy O
Hooker' O
type O
protagonist O
is O
a O
lot O
more O
palatable O
than O
an O
even O
nearly O
realistic O
character, O
which O
for O
me O
begs O
the O
question O
if O
you O
make O
a O
movie O
about O
a O
type O
of O
person O
but O
are O
too O
chicken O
scared O
to O
adorn O
that O
player O
with O
the O
characteristics O
familiar O
to O
that O
role O
then O
why O
do O
it? O
If O
I O
make O
a O
film O
about O
a O
chef O
but O
don't O
want O
him O
to O
cook O
or O
talk O
about O
food O
or O
wear O
a O
white O
hat O
then O
why O
make O
a O
film O
about O
a O
chef O
in O
the O
first O
place? O
By O
bailing O
out O
and O
turning O
the O
hooker O
into O
a O
respectable O
dancer O
type O
the O
story B-STORY
misses O
the O
point O
completely O
and O
consequently O
never O
indulges O
in O
any O
of O
the O
moral O
or O
social O
questions O
that O
it O
could O
have, O
what O
a O
cop O
out, O
really O
really O
lame. O
<br O
/><br O
/>Secondly, O
'Pretty O
Woman' O
insults O
romance B-STORY
itself, O
Edward O
Lewis O
played O
by O
Richard O
Gere B-CAST
has O
no O
clue O
how O
to O
seduce O
or O
romance B-STORY
this O
'lady' O
that O
is O
without O
his O
plastic O
friend, O
yep O
don't O
leave O
home O
without O
it, O
especially O
if O
you O
are O
a O
moron O
in O
a O
suit O
who O
has O
no O
imagination. O
8 O
out O
of O
10 O
of O
his O
romantic B-FRANCHISE
moments O
involve O
splashing O
cash O
in O
one O
way O
or O
another, O
even O
when O
he O
first O
meets O
her O
it's O
the O
Lotus O

that O
does O
all O
the O

where's O

where's O
the O

don't O
mention O
that O
attempt O
at O

please.<br O

who O
like O
this O

will O
also O
be O
girls O
who O
like O
shopping O
more O
than O
most. O
Guys O
who O

not O

have O
realized O
that O
old O

has O
less O

than O
a O

as O
they O
probably O
don't O
either O
so O
it O
wont O
have O

More O
importantly O
anyone O
who O
likes O
this O

will O
hate O
'Thieves O

a O
wonderful O
story B-STORY
of O
which O
part O
is O
based O
on O
the O

finish O
on O
a O
song:<br O

right O

This O
movie O
was O
terrible. O
The O
plot B-CLICHES
was O
terrible O
and O
unbelievable. O
I O
cannot O
recommend O
this O
movie. O
Where O
did O
this O
movie O
come O
from? O
This O
movie O
was O
not O
funny B-HUMOR
and O
wasted O
the O
talent O
of O
some O
great O
actors O
and O
actresses O
including: O
Gary O
Sinise, O
Kathy O
Bates, O
Joey O
Lauren O
Adams, O
and O
Jennifer O
Tilly. O

I O
strongly O
dislike O
this O
show. O
I O
mean, O
like, O
basically O
everyone O
at O
that O
school O
is O
perfect, O
and O
rich, B-CLICHES
and O
I O
doubt O
a O
boarding O
school O
would O
look O
as O
cool B-MUSIC
as O
that. O
And O
why O
do O
they O
suddenly O
allow O
girls O
into O
the O
school? O
Isn't O
that O
just O
a O
little O
weird? O
anyways, O
Jamie O
Lynn O
spears O
CANNOT O
act. O
She O
always O
has O
the O
same O
facial O
expression, O
which O
really O
annoys O
me. O
She O
is O
basically O
emotionless, O
and O
all O
the O
guys O
seem O
to O
like O
her.<br O
/><br O
/>and O
shouldn't O
chase O
tell O
her O
he O
likes O
her? O
its O
not O
that O
hard! O
really! O
None O
of O
this O
show O
is O
real O
life, O
and O
she O
isn't O
"a O
girl O
like O
me" O
because O
majority O
of O
the O
regular O
girls O
do O
NOT O
go O
to O
boarding O
school, O
do O
not O
have O
designer O
clothes, O
and O
do O
NOT O
live O
by O
the O
beach.<br O
/><br O
/>fake O
fake O
fake. O

Normally O
I O
don't O
like O
series B-FRANCHISE
at O
all. O
They're O
all O
to O
predictable B-CLICHES
and O
they O
tend O
to O
become O
boring B-TONE
and O
dull B-TONE
very O
fast.<br O
/><br O
/>These O
series B-FRANCHISE
however, O
are O
well O
played, O
the O
story B-STORY
follows O
through O
all O
episodes O
and O
even O
if O
you O
miss O
one, O
the O
story B-STORY
will O
still O
be O
catching O
your O
mind.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
episodes O
are O
all O
filmed O
on O
a O
hospital O
and O
takes O
you O
further O
and O
further O
in O
to O
the O
mysteries O
of O
dark B-HUMOR
and O
old O
secrets O
that O
lies O
just O
beneath O

mighty O

holy O
Sh*t O

sat O
in O

ten O

to O
gouge O
out O
my O
eyes O
much O
in O
the O
manor O
Oedipus O

dear O
god. O
this O
movie O
deserves O
no O
more O
credit O
than O
anything O
done O
by O
a O
middle O
school O

buff. O
please O
save O
your O
money, O
this O
movie O
can O
offer O
you O
nothing. O
unless O
you O
enjoy O

This O

without O

10/10.. O
for O
all O
you O

out O

who O

rating O

low O

because O
it O
has O
no O
"good B-CAST

or O
anything O
like O
that, O
thats O
ridiculous, B-TONE
saying O
that O
a O
Jackie O

movie O
is O
bad O
because O
of O
its O

is O
like O
saying O
a O
porn O

is O
bad O

FOR O
THE O
FIGHT B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS

for O
the O
action B-GENRE
its O
not O
so O
much O
concentrated O
on O
a O
good B-CAST
story B-STORY
or O
anything O
like O
that, O
if O
you O
look O
at O
how O
he O
makes O
movies O
and O
compare O
it O
to O
other O
American O
films O
from O
that O
era O
and O
even O
later O
you O
will O
realize O
that O
Jackie O
Chan's O
movies O
had O
over O
the O
top O
fights O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
and O
not O
really O
good B-CAST
plots O
while O
American O
movies O
had O
good B-CAST
plots O
but O
shitty O
action B-GENRE
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
compared O
to O
what O
Jackie O
Chan O
was O
doing O
at O
the O
time. O
Porn O
is O
watched O
for O
the O
porn, O
Jackie O
Chan O
is O
watched O
for O
the O
ACTION, B-GENRE
i O
think O
you O
people O
are O
rating O
it O
bad O
because O
there's O
no O
plot B-CLICHES
because O
you O
think O
thats O
how O
a O
smart O
movie O
critic O
would O
rate O
a O
good B-CAST
movie O
but O
the O
way O
i O
see O
it O
is O
a O
good B-CAST
movie O
is O
a O
movie O
that O
can O
keep O
me O
entertained. O
Sure O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
movie O
was O
boring, B-TONE
VERY O
BORING, B-TONE
but O
put O
it O
this O
way O
the O
rest O
which O
is O
all O
action B-GENRE
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
and O
stunts B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
very O
much O
do O
pay O
for O
all O
of O
that. O
This O
did O
change O
the O
way O
how O
American O
action B-GENRE
movies O
were O
created, O
they O
have O
even O
stollen O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
from O
this O
movie. O
If O
you O
want O
a O
true O
man, O
a O
true O
entertainer O
then O
watch O
this O
movie O
and O
many O
more O
of O
Jackie O
Chan's, O
hes O
pure O
in O
everyway. O
He O
literally O
makes O
American O
movies O
look O
like O
a O
walk O
in O
the O
park, O
and O
even O
in O
TODAYS O
movies. O
American O
movies O
rely O
so O
much O
on O
special B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
effects O
and O
safety O
wires O
and O
stunt O
doubles O
and O
so O
much O
more. O
Police O
Story B-STORY
and O
many O
other O
Jackie O

are O
pieces O
of O
work O
of O
a O
true O
entertainer O
who O
just O
goes O
all O
out O
and O
is O
very O
talented O
in O
what O
he O
can O
do. O

very O
deftly O
blends O
his O
investigation O
of O
the O

wider O
concerns O
about O
globalisation, O

film O
is O
shot O
on O
hand-held B-CINEMATOGRAPHY

which O
some O
might O
find O
offputting, O
but O
which O
does O
enable O
Nossiter O
to O
catch O
people O
off O
guard O
on O
a O
number O
of O
occasions O
which O
probably O
would O
not O
have O
been O
possible O
using O

/><br O
/>Despite O
the O
sprawling O
feel O
of O
the O
film, O
the O
editing B-DIRECTION
is O
very O
sharp, O
not O
only O
giving O
us O
a O
parade O
of O
the O
world's O
dogs, O
but O
also O
undercutting O
a O
number O
of O
interviewees' O
comments O
with O
somewhat O
contradictory O
visual B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
images, O
and O
giving O
others O
sufficient O
rope O
to O
hang O
themselves. O
To O
a O
degree O
this O
evoked O
Michael O
Moore's O
recent O
work O
(although O
Nossiter O
operates O
in O
a O
more O
subtle O
way), O
but O
probably O
the O
roots O
of O
the O
film O
go O
back O
to O
Marcel O
Ophuls' O
"The O
Sorrow O

the O
Pity", O
both O
in O
the O
way O
the O

I O
bet O
that O

off O

no O

take O
credit O
for O

It O
is O
understandable O
why O
this O
director B-DIRECTION
has O
so O
many O
aliases. O
There O
is O
a O
bright O
side O
to O
watching O

that O
if O
you O
can O
get O
someone O
to O
bring O

sports B-GENRE
a O
nice, O
deep O

for O
a O
thriller B-GENRE
you O
better O
deliver O
more O
than O
name O
actors O
and O
talk. O
The O
first O
third O
of O
this O
movie O
was O
nothing O
but O
talk, O
and O
more O
talk. O
Most O
of O
that O
was O
a O
bunch O
of O
women O
bitching O
about O
everything O
to O
each O
other. O
<br O
/><br O
/>The O
first O
five O
listed O
actors O
in O
here O
are O
women O
so O
that O
verifies O
that O
it's O
really O
a O
"chick O
flick" O
and O
little O
else. O
This O
probably O
plays O
on O
the O
Lifetime O
network.<br O
/><br O
/>There O
was O
a O
quick O
murder B-GENRE
scene O
and O
then O
more O
talk. O
By O
halfway O
through, O
they O
had O
lost O
me. O
<br O
/><br O
/>By O
the O
way, O
Sally O
Field O
looked O
about O
15 O
years O
old O
in O
here. O

I O
think O
this O
movie O
has O
got O
it O
all. O
It O
has O
really O
cool B-MUSIC
music B-MUSIC
that O
I O
can O
never O
get O
out O
of O
my O
head. O
It O
has O
cool B-MUSIC
looking O
characters. B-CAST
IS O
REALLY O
funny(you O
know, O
the O
kind O
that O
you'll O
crack O
up O
on O
the O
ground O
and O
you'll O
keep O
saying O
the O
funny B-HUMOR
parts O
over O
every O

for O
three O
weeks).Despite O
the O
bad O

bad O
cgi, B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
and O
bad O
story(about O
cops O
going O
after O

its O
really O

watch O
it O
two O
more O
times.<br O
/><br O

are O
so O
many O
funny B-HUMOR
parts, O
like O
when O
Kurt O
was O
trying O
to O
get O
Edison's O
attention O
and O
gave O
him O
the O
finger, O
and O
then O
threw O
a O
paint O
ball O
gun O
at O
him O
so O
they O
could O
play O
paint O
ball. O
On O
that O
part, O
I O
kept O
saying O
"Remember, O
Remember?"to O
my O
cousins O
who O
saw O
it O
and O
showed O
them O
what O
happened. O
There O
was O
also O
a O
really O
funny B-HUMOR
part O
when O
Edision O
ran O
into O
the O
room O
and O
Kurt O
was O
there(just O
before O
they O
fought) O
and O
Kurt O
was O
talking O
about O
his O
"Strange O
dream" O
and O
how O
he O
was O
"Superman". O
I O
LOVED O
that O
part, O
although O
it O
has O
been O
a O
while O
since O
I O
saw O
it, O
so O
I O
don't O
remember O
that O
part. O
Everything O
the O
actors O
said O
were O
funny, B-HUMOR
like O
how O
Kurt O
says, O
"I O
worship O
you, O
like O
a O
GOD!" O
to O
the O
robot.<br O
/><br O
/>Although O
there O
was O
some O
bad O
things, O
in O
all O
it O
was O
a O
GREAT O
movie. O
Man, O

the O
production O
are O
very, O
very O
nice. O
But, O
the O
insightful, O
humorous, O
and O
the O
thoughtful O
look O
at O
the O
gay O
population O
is O
the O
film's O
best O
asset, O
no O
doubt. O
For O
those O
who O
would O
be O
offended O
by O
a O
gay-themed O
film, O
yes, O
just O
skip O
over O
this O
one. O
But, O
for O
everyone O
who O
wants O
to O
laugh O
heartily, O
and O
gain O
a O
better O
understanding O
of O
the O
gay O
situation O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
this O
is O
definitely O
the O
best O
film O
out O
there. O

When O
the O
opening O
shot O
is O
U.S. O
Marines O
seriously O
disrespecting O
the O
U.S. O
flag, O
a O
movie O
has O
a O
tough O
road O
ahead, O
but O
unfortunately O
it O
was O
downhill O
from O
there. O
There O
is O
a O
military O
adviser O
credited, O
who O
is O
also O
apparently O
a O
retired O
U.S. O
Marine, O
making O
it O
even O
more O
baffling O
that O
this O
incredible O
breach O
of O
protocol, O
and O
law, O
went O
unnoticed. O
Even O
more O
baffling O
is O
the O
way O
they O
simply O
glossed O
over O
how O
a O
Marine O
is O
reported O
KIA, O
then O
buried, O
in O
very O
short B-CAST
order, O
without O
the O
slightest O
explanation O
of O
how O
they O
identified O
the O
body, O
or O
if O
there O
even O
was O
a O
body. O
The O
U.S. O
government O
is O
still O
finding O
the O
missing O
from O
WWII, O
and O
it O
takes O
months O
to O
identify O
the O
remains. O
Military O
shot O
down O
remain O
MIA O
for O
months O
or O
years O
and O
are O
only O
declared O
KIA O
when O
the O
remains O
have O
been O
positively O
identified, O
or O
after O
years O
of O
red O
tape. O
Here O
we O
are O
expected O
to O
believe O
that O
it O
happens O
within O
a O
matter O
of O
days O
or O
weeks. O
Maybe O
this O
happens O
in O
Denmark, O
but O
not O
in O
the O
U.S. O
Clearly O
none O
of O
the O
people O
involved O
ever O
had O
the O
slightest O
involvement O
with, O
or O
respect O
for, O
the O
U.S. O
military.<br O
/><br O
/>Beyond O
that, O
there O
are O
a O
number O
of O
other O
utterly O
laughable O
moments O
when O
characters B-CAST
come O
up O
with O
zingers O
out O
of O
nowhere. O
There O
must O
have O
been O
some O
really O
extended O
meetings O
between O
auteur O
and O
actors O
as O
they O
struggled O
to O
find O
their O
motivation B-STORY
for O
such O
hogwash. O
Having O
a O
script B-STORY
that O
worked O
might O
have O
helped, O
but O
this O
one O
seems O
to O
have O
been O
made O
up O
on O
the O
spot, O
working O
from O
Cliffs O
Notes. O
There's O
no O
way O
to O
know O
if O
the O
script B-STORY
was O
this O
awful O
originally, O
or O
if O
it O
was O
the O
auteur, O
or O
the O
middle-management O
kids O
at O
the O
studio O
who O
bear O
responsibility. O
Either O
way, O
this O
is O
an O
awful O
movie O
that O
should O
have O
never O
been O
made. O

We O
usually O
think O
of O
the O
British O
as O
the O
experts O
at O
rendering O
great O
adventure B-GENRE
from O
the O
Imperial O
age, O
with O
the O
likes O
of O
The O
Four O
Feathers O
(1939) O
and O
Zulu, O
simply O
because O
the O
Imperial O
age O
was, O
for O
the O
most O
part, O
British. O
Here, O
in O
The O
Wind O
and O
the O
Lion, O
we O
see O
a O
wonderful O
rendering O
of O
America's O
own O
Imperial O
age.<br O
/><br O
/>America's O
projection O
of O
power O
under O
Teddy O
Roosevelt O
is O
the O
backdrop O
for O
this O
conventional O
tale O
of O
the O
kidnapped O
damsel O
who, O
despite O
her O
gentility, O
is O
smitten O
by O
the O
rough, O
manly O
nobility O
of O
her O
captor, O
who O
in O
turn O
is O
disarmed O
by O
her O
beauty O
and O
scorn. O
(Politically O
correct O

eager O
to O
see O
some O
slight O
of O

that O
the O

largely O
through O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O

every O
member O
of O
the O
family B-FRANCHISE
can O
identify O
with O
one O
of O
the O
characters, B-CAST
whether O
it O
be O
Sean O
Connery's O
noble B-GENRE
brigand, O
Candace O
Bergen's O
feisty O
heroine, O
John O
Huston's O

Steve O
Kanaly's O
spiffy, O
radiant, O
ruthless O

"Big O

There O
is O
a O
transcendent O
scene O
at O
the O
end, O
when O
the O
little O
boy O
is O
symbolically O
swept O
away O
by O
the O
dashing O
Moor O
on O
his O
white O
steed. O
This O
is O
high O
adventure B-GENRE
at O
its O
best. O

I O
had O
been O
looking O
forward O
to O
seeing O
Dreamgirls O
for O
quite O
a O
while...what O
with O
all O
it's O
raving O
reviews, O
nominations O
and O
media O
attention. O
And O
I O
must O
say, O
the O
first O
quarter O
of O
the O
movie O
was O
good! B-CAST
It O
really O
portrayed O
the O
black B-HUMOR
music B-MUSIC
scene O
back O
then. O
However, O
as O
the O
movie O
wore O
on, O
me O
and O
my O
whole O
family B-FRANCHISE
were O
bored O
out O
of O
our O
wits. O
The O
singing O
just O
kept O
coming, O
one O
after O
the O
other. O
I O
mean O
seriously, O
just O
one O
more O
music B-MUSIC
number O
and O
it O
would O
have O
broke O
even O
with O
RENT.<br O
/><br O
/>Furthermore, O
I O
noticed O
hardly O
any O
character O
development O
in O
any O
of O
the O
characters; B-CAST
I O
just O
didn't O
care O
what O
happened O
to O
them! O
Even O
when O
Eddie O
Murphy's O
character O
died O
of O
a O
drug O
overdose, O
I O
knew O
I O
should O
have O
been O
sad, O
but O
I O
just O
couldn't O
feel O
any O
emotion O
for O
that O
character. O
The O
characters B-CAST
were O
given O
a O
flimsy O
background O
about O
singing O
in O
their O
childhood O
and O
whatnot, O
but O
there O
personalities O
were O
not O
revealed O
enough O
to O
draw O
me O
in.<br O
/><br O
/>Finally, O
the O
conflict B-STORY
was O
simply O
not O
significant O
enough O
to O
make O
the O
viewer O
care, O
which O
goes O
along O
with O
the O
lack O
of O
character O
development. O
This O
movie O
reminded O
me O
of O
a O
copy-cat B-CLICHES
movie O
based O
on O
Ray, O
Chicago, O
and O
Rent O
(Ray O
and O
Chicago O
were O
wonderful O
movies O
in O
my O
opinion). O
Overall O
I O
think O
this O
movie O
would O
best O
suit O
someone O
who O
doesn't O
really O
care O
about O
an O
overall O
story, B-STORY
yet O
would O
enjoy O
two O
hours O
of O
entertaining O
and O
fun B-PERFORMANCE
singing O
performances. O

One O
of O
Starewicz's O
longest O

follows O
a O
toy O

in O
search O
of O
an O

after O
becoming O
animated O
by O
the O
tear O
of O
the O
mother O

a O

who O
longs O
for O
an O
orange. O
The O

at O
night B-STORY
must O
protect O

when O
he O
comes O
enters O
a O
devilish O

many O
bizarre O

With O
the O
help O

a O

the O

gets O
the O
orange O
back O
to O
the O

she O
is O
saved O
from O

scurvy O

The O
Mascot O
features O
new O
techniques O
I O
have O
not O
yet O
seen O
in O
Starewicz's O

The O
addition O
of O

sound O
and O
a O
mixture O
of O
live O
action B-GENRE
with O
the O
stop-motion O
animation O
makes O
for O
a O
new O
twist B-CLICHES

a O
puppet O
sits O
on O
the O
concrete O

impressive B-PERFORMANCE
and O
fresh. O
The O
honking O
of O
cars O
and O
cries O
of O
street O
vendors O
is O
noteworthy O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
small O
studio O
shifts O
to O
sound O
were O
costly O
and O
Starewicz's O
utilization O
of O
the O
new O
technology O
seems O
like O
old O
hat. O
New O
puppet O
characters B-CAST
in O
this O

are O
frightening O
contributions O
to O
the O

A O
new O

technique B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
uses O
quick O

what O
before O

been O
a O
slow B-TONE

Overall, O
Starewicz O
is O
able O
to O
update O
his O
style O
of O
film-making O
to O
meet O
the O
demands O
of O
a O
new O
audience O
making O
this O
film O
one O
of O
the O
best O
examples O
of O
his O
work. O

Nice O
character O
development O
in O
a O
pretty O
cool B-MUSIC
milieu. O
Being O
a O
male, O
I'm O
probably O
not O
qualified O
to O
totally O
understand O
it, O
but O
they O
do O
a O
nice O
job O
of O
establishing O
the O
restrictive O
Victorian O
environment O
from O
the O
start. O
It O
isn't O
as O
bleak B-TONE
as O
it O
really O
was O
and O
the O
treatment O
of O
women O
was O
probably O
even O
harsher. O
What O
makes O
this O
go O
is O
a O
wonderful O
chemistry O
among O
the O
principal O
characters. B-CAST
Each O
has O
their O
own O
"thing" O
that O
they O
contend O
with. O
Once O
they O
come O
out O
of O
the O

break O
out O

they O
begin O
to O
interact O
and O
slowly O
lose O
their O
sense O

suspicion. O
What O
I O
enjoyed O
about O

didn't O
go O

THE O

the O
closest O
to O
a O

I O
think O
you O
can O
also O
see O
the O
influence O
of O

on O
this O

Many O
might O
consider O
Sir O

due O
to O
his O
bumbling, O

how O

instead O
follows O

Capable O

and O
the O

is O
full O
of O
interesting O
characters B-CAST

lurid O
content..the O
fact O
that O
so O
many O
of O
the O

surrounding O

are O

any O

I'd O
say O
this O

one O
of O
the O
best(..if O
not O
the O

of O

are O
quite O
eye-opening(..and, O
you O
even O
get O
a O
literal O

the O

I O
was O
very O
lucky O
to O
see O
this O
film O
as O
part O
of O
the O
Melbourne O
International O
Film O
Festival O
2005 O
only O
a O
few O
days O
ago. O
I O
must O
admit O
that O
I O
am O
very O
partial O
to O
movies O
that O
focus O
on O
human O
relations O
and O
especially O
the O
ones O
which O
concentrate O
on O
the O
tragic B-STORY
side O
of O
life. O
I O
also O
love O
the O
majority O
of O
Scandinavian O
cinematic B-MUSIC
offerings, O
there O
is O
often O
a O
particular O
deep O
quality O
in O
the O
way O
the O
story B-STORY
unfolds O
and O
the O
characters B-CAST
are O
drawn. O
Character O
building O
in O
this O
film O
is O
extraordinary O
in O
its O
details O
and O
its O
depth. O
This O
is O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
do O
encounter O
quite O
a O
number O
of O
characters B-CAST
all O
with O
very O
particular O
personal O
situations O
and O
locations O
within O
their O
community. O
The O
audience O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
screening O
was O
very O
silent B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
and O
pensive. O
I O
am O
still O
playing O
some O
of O
those O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
in O
my O
mind O
and O
I O
am O
still O
amazed O
at O
their O
power O
and O
meaningfulness. O

This O
movie O
is O
really O
bad. O
Most O
of O
it O
looks O
like O
it O
was O
filmed O
either O
in O
a O
park O
or O
a O
basement. O
There's O
a O
giant O
spider O
but O
all O
we O
see O
of O
it O
is O
one O
leg. O
There O
are O
some O
worms O
that O
live O
in O
a O
cave O
that O
are O
just O
cheap B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
sock O
puppets O
with O
cardboard O
teeth. O
And O
the O
plot B-CLICHES
is O
a O
bunch O
of O
post-apocalyptic B-STORY
mumbo O
jumbo O
that O
makes O
no O
sense O
at O
all. O
The O
whole O
thing O
is O
just O
laughable. O

I O
think O
this O
is O
one O
hell O
of O
a O
movie...........We O
can O
see O
Steven O
fighting O
around O
with O
his O
martial O
art B-GENRE
stuff O
again O
and O
like O
in O
all O
Segal O
movies O
there's O
a O
message O
in O
it, O
without O
the O
message O
it O
would O
be O
one O
of O
many O
action/fighting O
movies O
but O
the O
message O
is O
what O
makes O
segal O
movies O
great O
and O
special. B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS

I O
saw O
this O
movie O
in O
the O
theater, O
and O
was O
thoroughly O
impressed O
by O
it. O
Then O
again, O
that O
was O
when O
Claire O
Danes B-CAST
was O
a O
good B-CAST
actress, B-CAST
not O
the O
foolish, O
arrogant, O
Hollywood-ized O
bitch O
she O
is O
today. O
Anyway, O
this O
film O
really O
struck O
me O
as O
one O
of O
the O
more O
raw, B-PERFORMANCE
realistic, O
beautiful O
friendship O
films. O
How O
far O
would O
you O
really O
go O
for O
your O
best O
friend? O
I O
was O
moved O
to O
tears O
at O
the O
end, O
and O
still O
tear O
up O
when O
I O
watch O
it O
now O
(I O
own O
it). O
I O
remember O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
left O
the O
theater, O
I O
called O
my O
best O
friend O
and O
sobbed O
to O
her O
how O
much O
I O
loved O
her. O
This O
is O
a O
great O
film O
to O
watch O
with O
your O
best O
girlfriend. O
However O
be O
prepared O
for O
the O
almost O
certain O
conversation O
afterward O
where O
she O
turns O
to O
you O
and O
asks O
if O
you'd O
do O
something O
like O
that O
for O
her.... O

I've O
seen O
this O
film O
literally O
over O
100 O
times...it's O
absolutely O
jam-packed O
with O
entertainment!!! O
Powers O
Boothe O
gives O
a O
stellar O
performance. B-CAST
As O
a O
fan O
of O
actors O
such O
as O
William O
Shatner O
(Impulse, O
1974) O
and O
Ron O
Liebmann O
(Up O
The O
Academy, O
1981)I O
never O
thought O
an O
actor B-CAST
could O
capture O
the O
"intensity" O
like O
Shatner O
and O
Liebmann O
in O
those O
roles, O
until O
I O
saw O
Boothe O
as O
Jim O
Jones! O
As O
far O
as O
I'm O
concerned, O
Powers O
Boothe O
IS O
Jim O
Jones...this O
film O
captures O
his O
best O
performance!!! B-CAST

The O
three O
main O
characters B-CAST
are O
all O
hopeless, O
and O
yet O
you O
only O
feel O
sorry O
for O
one O
of O
them: O
Ernesto, O
hopelessly O
devoted O
to O
Mercedes. O
This O
was O
part O
of O
the O
frustration: O
screaming O
at O
Mercedes O
to O
get O
a O
clue O
and O
ditch O
the O
no-good O
Harry, O
to O
no O
avail.<br O
/><br O
/>Then O
there's O
the O
satisfaction: O
Steve O
Buscemi O
has O
a O
great O
part O
as O
a O
transvestite, O
and O
Harvey O
Keitel's O
moving O
story B-STORY
of O
his O
indignity O
playing O
a O
gorilla O
for O
a O
cheap B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
TV O
movie O
is O
incredible. O
When O
you O
least O
expect O
it, O
Quentin O
Tarintino O
is O
doing O
half O
a O
monologue, O
and O
Anthony O
Quinn O
turns O
Ernesto O
into O
a O
wealthy O
man.<br O
/><br O
/>Time O
and O
again O
great O
moments O
appear O
in O
the O
story, B-STORY
but O
in O
the O
end O
it's O
hard O
to O
know O
what O
to O
feel O
about O
this O
movie. O
It O
doesn't O
have O
a O
happy O
ending, O
or O
even O
a O
complete O
one, O
but O
it O
somehow O
feels O
right.<br O
/><br O
/>This O
movie O
is O
strange, O
but O
then O
so O
am O
I; O
no O
wonder O
I O
liked O
it. O

Reese O
Witherspoon O
first O
outing O
on O
the O
big O
screen O
was O
a O
memorable B-MUSIC
one. O
She O
appears O
like O
a O
fresh O
scrubbed O
face O
"tween" O
slight O
and O
stringy, O
but O
undeniably O
Reese.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
have O
always O
liked O
her O
as O
an O
actor, B-CAST
and O
had O
no O
idea O
she O
started O
this O
young O
with O
her O
career, O
go O
figure. O
I O
actually O
gained O
some O
respect O
for O
Reese O
to O
know O
who O
she O
was O
so O
early O
on. O
I O
say O
that O
because O
whenever O
I O
have O
watched O
her O
perform, O
the O
characters B-CAST
thus O
far, O
in O
each O
portrayal O
she O
also O
seemed O
to O
have O
her O
own O
persona O
that O
lived O
with O
that O
character, O
quite O
nicely O
in O
fact.<br O
/><br O
/>Anyway, O
my O
first O
film O
experience O
with O
Reese O
was O
the O
Little O
Red O
Riding O
Hood O
parody B-HUMOR
Reese O
did O
with O
Kiefer O
Sutherland, O
somehow O
I O
assumed O
that O
was O
her O
first O
time O
up O
"at O
bat" O
Not O
so, O
well O
done O
Reese O

This O
game O
ranks O
above O
all O
so O
far. O
I O
had O
the O
honor O
of O
playing O
mine O
on O
PS2 O
so O
the O
graphics O
were O
really O
good. B-CAST
The O
voice O
acting B-CAST
was O
above O
standard. O
The O
difficulty O
level O
is O
just O
right. O
Wesker O
has O
to O
be O
the O
best O
characters B-CAST
in O
the O
RE O
series B-FRANCHISE
in O
my O
opinion. O
The O
story B-STORY
amazed O
me O
and O
took O
many O
different O
twist B-CLICHES
that O
I O
wasn't O
expecting. O
The O
only O
rating O
this O
game O
deserves O
is O
great. O

This O
movie O
is O
not O
worth O
anything. O
I O
mean, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
watch O
this O
kind O
of O
stuff, O
flip O
to O
Hollywood O
movies! O
This O
totally O
is O
a O
disgrace O
to O
the O
Bollywood O
name. O
Neal O
N O
Nikki O
seriously O
sucked! O
Never O
watch O
this O
movie. O
As O
for O
the O
actors, O
it O
appears O
the O
acting B-CAST
genes O
skipped O
a O
generation. O
Tanisha O
couldn't O
have O
worn O
less O
and O
Uday O
Chopra O
obviously O
was O
just O
picked O
because O
he O
was O
the O
director's O
spoiled O
son. O
(All O
of O
that O
Halla O
Re O
was O
amazingly O
stupid) O
The O
songs B-MUSIC
are O
eh, O
and O
I O
hope O
the O
director B-DIRECTION
did O
not O
spend O
to O
much O
money O
on O
it...... O
Bottom O
line, O
I O
hated O
the O
movie. O
Do O
not O
let O
your O
kids O
watch O
it, O
and O
if O
you O
have O
it O
in O
your O
house O
it O
is O
a O
stupid O
movie O
so O
discard O
it! O
Buy O
the O
CD, O
if O
you O
must. O
(As O
I O
said, O
the O
songs B-MUSIC
are O
eh.) O
At O
least O
it O
is O
better O
then O
the O
movie. O

This O
is O
yet O
another O
western B-FRANCHISE
about O
a O
greedy O
cattle O
baron O
looking O
to O
push O
out O
small O
ranchers O
and O
farmers. O
It's O
certainly O
all O
been O
done O
before O
and O
since. O
But O
The O
Violent O
Men O
is O
something O
special.<br O
/><br O
/>What O
makes O
it O
special B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
is O
Barbara O
Stanwyck B-CAST
playing O
the O
role O
of O
vixen O
as O
she O
often O
did O
in O

infidelity O

takes O
over O
the O

He's O
every O

the O
quiet O
western B-FRANCHISE
hero B-CLICHES
who O
people O
make O
the O
mistake O
of O
pushing O

I O
almost O
expect O
those O
famous O
words O
from O

come O
out O
of O
Ford's O
mouth, O
"I'm O

Would O
have O
been O
very O
applicable O
in O
The O

/><br O
/>The O
Fifties O
was O
the O
age O
of O
the O
adult O
western, B-FRANCHISE
themes O
were O
entering O
into O
horse O
operas O
that O
hadn't O
been O
explored O
before. O
The O
following O
year O
Glenn O
Ford O
would O
do O
another O
western, B-FRANCHISE
Jubal, O
one O
of O
his O
best O
which O
also O
explores O
infidelity O
as O
a O
plot B-CLICHES
component.<br O
/><br O

enough O
traditional O
western B-FRANCHISE
stuff O

plenty O
for O
those O
who O
are O
addicted O
to O
soap B-GENRE

Apparently, O
The O
Mutilation O

is O
about O
a O
guy O
who O
wanders O
the O
land O
performing O
shows O
of O
self-mutilation O
as O
a O
way O
of O
coping O
with O

I O
use O
the O
word O
'apparently' O
because O
without O

this O

a O
real O

minutes O
of O
ugly O

accompanied O
by O

terrible O

this O
mind-numbingly O
awful O
drivel O
is O
the O
perfect O
way O
to O
test O
one's O
sanity: O
if O
you've O
still O
got O
all O
your O

you'll O
switch O
this O
rubbish O
off O

watch O
something O

(I O
watched O
the O
whole O
thing, O
but O
am O
well O
aware O
that O
I'm O
completely O
barking!). O

This O
movie O
was O
absolutely O
pathetic. O
A O
pitiful O
screenplay O
and O
lack O
of O
any O
story B-STORY
just O
left O
me O
watching O
three O

over O

At O
times O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
watching O
an O
episode O
of O
Beavis O

I O
couldn't O
even O
sit O
through O
the O
whole O

Emran O
Hashmi O
disappoints, O
and O
Hrshitta O
Bhatt O
is O
not O
impressive B-PERFORMANCE
at O
all. O
Celina O
Jaitley O
was O
not O
bad. O
The O
only O
worthwhile O
part O
of O
the O
film O
is O
the O
spoof O
on O
Anu O
Malik O
and O
his O
obsession B-CLICHES
of O

It O
was O
pretty O
hilarious. B-TONE
The O
songs B-MUSIC
"Sini O

You O
can O
always O
count O
on O

I'd O
like O
to O
think O
this O

really O
what O

do/did. O
Giambone O
was O
a O
real O
favourite! O
On O
a O
Canadian O

I O
learned O
EVERY O
Canadian O
actor's O
name O
and O
style O
from O
guest O
spots O
done O
on O
Night B-STORY

Everyone O
passed O
through O
the O
Night B-STORY
Heat O
set O
and O
like O
Law O
& O
Order, O
it O
was O
story-driven O
so O
you O
could O
just O
watch O
and O
enjoy O
without O
a O
lot O
of O
character O
melodrama. O

This O
movie O
fails O
miserably O
on O
every O
level. O
I O
have O
an O
idea, O
let's O
take O
everyone O
involved O
in O
this O
movie O
and O
ship O
them O
into O
a O
hot O
zone O
in O
the O
middle O
east. O
Maybe O
if O
we're O
lucky O
they'll O
all O
be O
shot O
and O
killed O
and O
we O
won't O
have O
to O
ever O
have O
our O
time O
wasted O
by O
them O
again. O
Did O
I O
mention O
that O
I O
have O
never O
been O
so O
bitter O
about O
a O
cinematic B-MUSIC
pile O
of O
crap O
in O
my O
entire O
life? O
My O
god, O
I O
can't O
think O
of O
anything O
I've O
ever O
seen O
that O
was O
this O
bad. O
I'd O
rather O
watch O
Ishtar O
25 O
times O
in O
a O
row O
than O
sit O
through O
10 O
minutes O
of O
this O
sorry O
excuse O
for O
a O
film. O
If O
I O
ever O
happen O
to O
meet O
anyone O
who O
was O
involved O
in O
this O
film, O
I'll O
spit O
in O
their O
face O
and O
then O
beat O
them O
senseless. O
That's O
my O
two O
cents. O

Yes O
i'll O
say O
before O
i O
start O
commenting, O
this O
movie O
is O
incredibly O
underrated.<br O
/><br O
/>Sharon O
Stone B-CAST
is O
great O
in O
her O
role O
of O
Catherine O
Trammell O
as O
is O
Morrissey O
as O
Dr O
glass. O
He O
is O
an O

sent O
in O
to O
evaluate O
her O
after O
the O
death O
of O
a O
sports B-GENRE
star. O
Glass O
is O
drawn O
into O
a O
seductive O
game O
that O
Trammel O
uses O
to O
manipulate O
his O
mind.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
acting B-CAST
was O
good B-CAST
(apart O
from O
Thewlis)<br O
/><br O
/>Stone B-CAST
really O
has O
a O
talent O
with O
this O
role. O
She's O
slick, O
naughty O
and O
seductive O
and O
doesn't O
look O
a O
day O
older O
than O
she O
did O
in O
the O
first.She O
really O
impressed O
me(like O
in O
Casino). O
Morrisey O
was O
also O
good. B-CAST
He O
showed O
much O
vunerablitity O
in O
a O
role O
that O
needed O
it. O
Thewlis O
however O
was O
lame. O
He O
ruined O
his O
character O
and O
was O
over-the-top B-REMAKES
the O
whole O
way. O
He O
really O
sucked.<br O
/><br O
/>Overall, O
this O
movie O
not O
as O
good B-CAST
the O
first O
but O
Stone B-CAST
is O
a O
hoot O
to O
watch. O
Just O
ignore O
Thewlis. O

Based O
on O
a O
Edgar O
Rice O
Burroughs O
novel, O
AT O
THE O
EARTH'S O
CORE O
provides O
little O
more O
than O
means O
to O
escape B-STORY
and O
give O
your O
brain O
a O
rest. O
A O
Victorian O
scientist O
Dr. O
Abner O
Perry(Peter O
Cushing)invents O
a O
giant O
burrowing O
machine, O
which O
he O
and O
his O
American O
partner(Doug O
McClure)use O
to O
corkscrew O
their O
way O
deep O
into O
the O
earth O
to O
explore O
what O
mysteries O
it O
may O
hold. O
They O
soon O
discover O
a O
lost O
world O
of O
subhuman O
creatures O
having O
conflict B-STORY
with O
prehistoric O
monsters.<br O
/><br O
/>Cushing O
comes O
across O
as O
an O
absent O
minded O
professor O
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
annoying. O
Instead O
of O
being O
a O
bold O
adventurer, O
he O
comes O
across O
effeminate. O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
McClure O
overacted O
enough O
to O
make O
himself O
also O
laughable. O
Caroline O
Munro O
plays O
the O
pretty O
Princess O
Dia O
that O
refuses O
to O
leave O
her O
world O
near O
the O
center O
of O

Also O
in O
the O
cast B-CAST
are: O
Godfrey O
James, O
Cy O
Grant O

Michael O
Crane. O

I O
have O
seen O
this O
film O
at O
least O
100 O
times O
and O
I O
am O
still O
excited O
by O
it, O
the O
acting B-CAST
is O
perfect O
and O
the O
romance B-STORY
between O
Joe O

Jean O
keeps O
me O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
my O
seat, O
plus O
I O
still O
think O
Bryan O
Brown O
is O
the O
tops. O
Brilliant O
Film. O

This O
show O
makes O
absolutely O
no O
sense. O
Every O
week, O
two O
ladies O
go O
to O
an O
estate O
to O
do O
some O
gardening, O
and O
every O
week O
without O
fail, O
they O
somehow O
stumble O
upon O
a O
murder. B-GENRE
Because O
everyone O
who O
owns O
a O
big O
house O
with O
a O
large O
garden O
is O
involved O
in O
a O
murder, B-GENRE
right? O
But O
even O
if O
they O
did O
somehow O
happen O
to O
stumble O
upon O
murder B-GENRE
after O
murder, B-GENRE
wouldn't O
the O
smart O
thing O
to O
do O
be O
to O
tell O
the O
police? O
You O
know, O
the O
people O
who O
can O
actually O
do O
something O
about O
it... O
But O
every O
week, O
these O
two O
fools O
go O
around, O
polluting O
evidence, O
committing O
crimes O
of O
their O
own, O
and, O
in O
some O
cases, O
causing O
more O
murders. B-STORY
Once O
they O
do O
miraculously O
solve O
the O
murders, B-STORY
there O
is O
no O
way O
the O
murderer O
could O
ever O
be O
convicted. O
All O
the O
evidence O
has O
been O
sabotaged. O
And O
you'd O
think O
people O
who O
are O
covering O
up O
murders B-STORY
would O
think O
not O
to O
hire O
these O
two, O
wouldn't O
you? O
Yay! O
We've O
solved O
the O
murder! B-GENRE
Now O
like O
every O
other O
week, O
let's O
go O
and O
confront O
the O
murderer O
ourselves O
and, O
with O
no O
back-up, O
tell O
them O
that O
we O
know O
about O
it. O
There O
is O
no O
way O
we O
could O
get O
ourselves O
into O
any O
danger, O
is O
there? O
Rosemary O
and O
Thyme O
is O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
shows O
on O
television, O
and O
certainly O
the O
most O
ridiculous. B-TONE

This O
movie O
was O
so O
bad O
it O
was O
funny! B-HUMOR
For O
awhile O
there O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
actually O
watching O
a O
parody B-HUMOR
of O
a O
bad O
movie O
(a O
la O
"For O
Your O
Consideration"). O
The O
"cliffhanger" O
scene O
at O
the O
end O
had O
me O
laughing O
until O
my O
insides O
hurt. O
The O
script B-STORY
was O
dreadful O
enough, O
but O
coupled O
with O
Sean O
Young's O
terrible O
acting B-CAST
-- O
especially O
while O
she O
explains O
the O
entire O
plot B-CLICHES
in O
great O
detail O
(complete O
with O
flashbacks) B-CLICHES
while O
dangling O
off O
a O
cliff O
-- O
makes O
it O
a O
truly O
classically O
bad O
movie O
worth O
watching! O
In O
fact O
the O
fakey O
shots B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
in O
this O
scene O
reminded O
me O
of O
an O
Ed O
Wood O
movie. O
I O
still O
can't O
believe O
how O
this O
thing O
got O
made. O
First O
of O
all, O
how O
did O
such O
a O
bad O
script B-STORY
get O
the O
green O
light? O
How O
did O
star O
actors O
get O
attached? O
Were O
they O
at O
low O
points O
in O
their O
careers? O
Questions, O
questions. O

Meryl O
Streep B-CAST
is O
such O
a O
genius. O
Well, O
at O
least O
as O
an O
actress. B-CAST
I O
know O
she's O
been O
made O
fun B-PERFORMANCE
of O
for O
doing O
a O
lot O
of O
roles O
with O
accents, O
but O
she O
nails O
the O
accent O
every O
time. O
Her O
performance B-CAST
as O
Lindy O
Chamberlain O
was O
inspiring. O
Mrs. O
Chamberlain, O
as O
portrayed O
here, O
was O
not O
particularly O
likable, O
nor O
all O
that O
smart. O
But O
that O
just O
makes O
Streep's O
work O
all O
the O
more O
remarkable. O
I O
think O
she O
is O
worth O
all O
10 O
or O
so O
of O
her O
Oscar B-PERFORMANCE
nominations. O
About O
the O
film, O
well, O
there O
were O
a O
couple O
of O
interesting O
things. O
I O
don't O
know O
much O
about O
Australia, O
but O
the O
theme B-MUSIC
of O
religious O
bigotry O
among O
the O
general O
public O
played O
a O
big O
part O
in O
the O
story. B-STORY
I O
had O
largely O
missed O
this O
when O
I O
first O
saw O
the O
film O
some O
years O
ago, O
but O
it O
came O
through O
loud O
and O
clear O
yesterday. O
And O
it O
seems O
the O
Australian O
press O
is O
just O
as O
accomplished O
at O
misery-inducing O
pursuit O
and O
overkill O
as O
their O
American O
colleagues. O
A O
pretty O
good B-CAST
film. O
A O
bit O
different. O
Grade: O
B O

'Airport O
4' O
is O
basically O
a O
slopped O
together O
mess O
for O
Universal O
Studios O
to O
try O
and O
work O
a O
new O
twist B-CLICHES
- O
the O
Concorde O
supersonic O
airliner O
- O
into O
their O
'disaster-in-the-sky' O
formula.<br O
/><br O
/>Bogged O
down O
with O
unintentional B-HUMOR
humor, O
the O
best O
of O
which O
is O
when O
George O
Kennedy O
sticks O
his O
hand O
out O
of O
Concorde's O
window O
at O
supersonic O
speed O
to O
fire O
a O
flare O
gun O
at O
a O
heat-seeking O
missile O
following O
the O
aircraft's O
flight O
path, O
and O
the O
simple O
fact O
that O
these O
dumb O
passengers O
keep O
re-boarding O
the O
same O
plane O
to O
continue O
their O
flight O
despite O
all O
the O
problems O
in O
the O
air. O
Many O
stars O
in O
this O
one O
including O
Robert O
Wagner, O
Sylvia O
Kristel, O
Alain O
Delon, O
and O
Martha O
Raye O
as O
a O
nervous O
passenger. O
<br O
/><br O
/>Not O
really O
related O
to O
the O
other O
'Airport' O
films. O

Supposedly O
a O
"social O
commentary" O
on O
racism O
and O
prison B-GENRE
conditions O
in O
the O
rural O
South O
of O
the O
1970's, O
"Nightmare" O
is O
full O
of O
bad O
Southern O
stereotypes, B-CLICHES
complete O
with O
phoney O
accents. O
Not O
only O
would O
it O
be O
offensive O
to O
the O
sensibilities O
of O
most O
American O
Southerners, O
this O
tawdry O
piece O
of O
work O
comes O
off O
as O
just O
a O
thinly-disguised O
"babe O
in O
prison" B-GENRE
movie--especially O
in O
its O
uncut O
original O
version. O
Nevertheless, O
acting B-CAST
is O
generally O
above O
average B-PERFORMANCE
and O
the O
late O
Chuck O
Connors, O
in O
particular, O
does O
a O
good B-CAST
job O
of O
making O
viewers O
hate O
him--even O
though O
he O
looks O
somewhat O
uncomfortable B-TONE
in O
several O
scenes. B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
There's O
also O
a O
change-of-pace O
role O
for O
the O
late O
Robert O
Reed, O
who O
appears O
as O
the O
lecherous O
warden, O
and O
Tina O
Louise O
(previously O
Ginger O
of O
"Gilligan's O
Island") O
made O
a O
rather O
believable B-PERFORMANCE
sadistic O
prison B-GENRE
guard. O
My O
grade: O
D. O
<br O
/><br O
/> O

OK, O
I O
bought O
this O
film O
from O
Woolworths O
for O
my O
friend O
for O
a O
joke O
present O
on O
his O
birthday, O
because O
the O
front O
cover O
had O
a O
sexual O
innuendo O
in O
it.<br O
/><br O
/>But O
we O
decided O
it O
to O
watch O
it O
anyway. O
Just O
for O
hilarity O
purposes.<br O
/><br O
/>And O
I'm O
sorry, O
but O
this O
has O
got O
to O
be, O
one O
of O
THE O
worst O
films O
in O
history.<br O
/><br O
/>It O
began O
off O
alright, O
and O
we O
thought O
"Ok O
this O
might O
actually O
be O
OK". O
But O
after O
about O
10 O
minutes, O
we O
were O
sadly O
mistaken.<br O
/><br O
/>It O
began O
when O
the O
"mysterious O
paint O
baller" O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
the O
most O
obvious O
character, O
the O
Scouser/Australian O
(I O
say O
that O
because O
he O
had O
an O
accent O
which O
couldn't O
be O
identified), O
who's O
acting B-CAST
might O
I O
just O
say, O
was O
abysmal.<br O
/><br O
/>Then O
it O
got O
to O
the O
end, O
and O
by O
that O
time, O
we O
had O
all O
lost O
the O
will O
to O
live. O
The O
paint O
ball O
finals.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
only O
thing O
I O
did O
like O
about O
this O
plot B-CLICHES
is O
that O
they O
didn't O
actually O
win, O
but O
annoyingly O
enough O
they O
won O
by O
default.<br O
/><br O
/>And O
I O
know O
this O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
it, O
but O
the O
name O
the O
team O
were O
given O
was O
just O
awful. O
Critical O
Damage. O
I O
mean O
they O
could O
of O
picked O
a O
more O
awesome O
name, O
like O
"The O
Destroyers O
of O
the O
Anti-Christ" O
or O
something. O
Or O
that's O
what O
the O
film O
should O
of O
been O
called O
anyway. O

Insignificant O
and O
low-brained O
(haha!) O
80's O
horror B-GENRE
like O
there O
are O
thirteen O
in O
a O
dozen, O
yet O
it O
can O
be O
considered O
amusing O
if O
you O
watch O
it O
in O
the O
right O
state O
of O
mind. O
The O
special B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
effects O
are O
tacky, O
the O
acting B-CAST
atrocious O
and O
the O
screenplay O
seems O
to O
miss O
a O
couple O
of O
essential O
paragraphs! O
"The O
Brain" O
takes O
place O
in O
a O
typical O
quiet-American O
town O
setting, O
where O
every O
adolescent O
works O
in O
the O
same O
diner O
and O
where O
the O
cool-kid O
in O
high O
school O
flushes O
cherry O
bombs O
down O
the O
toilet. O
It O
is O
here O
that O
a O
TV-guru O
named O
Dr. O
Blake O
and O
his O
adorable O
pet-brain O
begin O
their O
quest O
for O
nation-wide O
mind O
controlling. O
Under O
the O
label O
of O
"independent O
thinkers", O
a O
giant O
cheesy B-HUMOR
brain O
sends O
out O
waves O
through O
television O
sets O
and O
forces O
innocent O
viewers O
to O
kill! O
How O
cool B-MUSIC
is O
that? O
Now, O
it's O
up O
to O
the O
Meadowvale O
teen-rebel O
to O
save O
the O
world! O
The O
funniest O
thing O
about O
the O
plot B-CLICHES
is O
that O
it O
never O
explains O
where O
Dr. O
Blake O
and O
his O
monstrous O
brain O
actually O
come O
from. O
There O
are O
obvious O
references O
towards O
extraterrestrial O
life O
but O
that's O
about O
it. O
Meh, O
who O
needs O
a O
background O
in O
a O
movie O
like O
this, O
really? O
There's O
not O
that O
much O
bloodshed O
unfortunately O
and O
the O
"evil" O
brain O
looks O
like O
an O
over-sized O
sock-puppet. O
The O
only O
more O
or O
less O
interesting O
element O
for O
horror B-GENRE
buffs O
is O
taking O
a O
look O
at O
the O
cast B-CAST
and O
crew O
who O
made O
this O
movie. O
Director B-DIRECTION
Ed O
Hunt O
and O
writer O
Barry O
Pearson O
are O
the O
same O
men O
who O
made O
"Bloody O
Birthday" O
(guilty O
pleasure O
of O
mine) O
and O
"Plague". O
Both O
those O
are O
much O
better O
movies O
and O
they O
wisely O
decided O
to O
resign O
the O
film O
industry. O
The O
most O
familiar O
face O
in O
the O
cast B-CAST
unquestionably O
is O
the O
great O
David O
Gale, O
whom O
horror B-GENRE
fans O
will O
worship O
forever O
for O
his O
role O
in O
Re-Animator. O
A O
girl O
named O
Christine O
Kossak O
provides O
the O
nudity-factor O
and O
she's O
obviously O
a O
great O
talent O
She O
has O
exactly O
3 O
movies O
on O
her O
repertoire O
of O
which O
THIS O
is O
her O
"masterpiece". O
In O
her O
debut, O
she O
was O
credited O
as O
'runaway O
model' O
and O
in O
"3 O
men O
and O
a O
baby", O
her O
character O
is O
referred O
to O
as O
'one O
of O
Jack's O
girls'. O
I O
really O
wonder O
how O
she O
feels O
about O
her O
career O
as O
an O
actress O

Does O
anyone O
remember O
the O
alternative O
comedy B-GENRE

accurately O
describes O
THE O
EVIL O

a O
Bronson O
vigilante O
thriller B-GENRE
where O
his O
motivation B-STORY
isn't O
down O
to O

this O
leads O
to O

a O
infamous O

It's O
never O
really O
explained O
why O
The O
Doctor O
is O
so O
infamous O
since O
any O
police O
state O
has O
a O
myriad O

ridiculous B-TONE

<br O

/>As O
you O
may O
guess O
it's O
a O
lazily O
written O
movie O
and O
incidents O
happening O
because O

needs O
things O

happen O
to O
further O
the O
plot B-CLICHES
no O
matter O
how O
unlikely O
they O
are O
like O
one O
of O
the O
bad O

he O

some O
T&A O
can O
be O
included O

/><br O
/>In O
many O
ways O
it's O
like O
one O
of O
those O
nasty O
Chuck O
Norris O
vehicles O
that O
were O
being O
released O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
but O
the O
most O
disappointing O
thing O
is O
that O
the O
director B-DIRECTION
is O
also O
the O
same O
man O
who O
made O
ICE O
COLD O
IN O
ALEX O
and O
THE O
GUNS O
OF O
NAVERONE O
two O
very O
well O
regarded O
war B-GENRE
dramas O
that O
are O
often O
shown O
on O
Sunday O
afternoons O
. O
Believe O
me O
this O
movie O
won't O
be O
shown O
until O
well O
after O
the O
watershed O

Well, O
here's O
another O
terrific B-PERFORMANCE
example O
of O
awkward O
70's O
film-making! O
The O
rudimentary O
premise O
of O
"What's O
the O
matter O
with O
Helen?" O
is O
quite O
shocking O
and O
disturbing, O
but O
it's O
presented O
in O
such O
a O
stylish O
and O
sophisticated O
fashion! O
In O
the O
hands O
of O
any O
other O
movie O
crew, O
this O
certainly O
would O
have O
become O
a O
nasty O
and O
gritty B-TONE
exploitation O
tale, O
but O
with O
director B-DIRECTION
Curtis O
Harrington B-DIRECTION
("Whoever O
Slew O
Auntie O
Roo?") O
and O
scriptwriter O
Henry O
Farrell O
("HushHushSweet O
Charlotte") O
in O
charge, O
it O
became O
a O
beautiful O
and O
almost O
enchanting O
mixture O
of O
themes O
and O
genres. O
The O
basic O
plot B-CLICHES
of O
the O
film O
is O
definitely O
horrific, O
but O
there's O
a O
lot O
more O
to O
experience, O
like O
love O
stories, O
a O
swinging O
1930's O
atmosphere O
and O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
singing O
and O
tap-dancing! O
The O
setting O
is O
unquestionably O
what O
makes O
this O
movie O
so O
unique. O
We're O
literally O
catapulted O
back O
to O
the O
1930's, O
with O
a O
sublime O
depiction O
of O
that O
era's O
music, B-MUSIC
religion, O
theatrical O
business O
and O
wardrobes. O
Following O
the O
long O
and O
exhausting O
trial O
that O
sentenced O
their O
sons O
to O
life-imprisonment O
for O
murder, B-GENRE
Adelle O
(Debbie O
Reynolds) O
and O
Helen O
(Shelley O
Winters) O
flee O
to O
California O
and O
attempt O
to O
start O
a O
new O
life O
running O
a O
dance O
school O
for O
young O
talented O
girls. O
Particularly O
Adelle O
adapts O
herself O
perfectly O
to O
the O
new O
environment, O
as O
she O
falls O
in O
love O
with O
a O
local O
millionaire, O
but O
poor O
old O
Helen O
continues O
to O
sink O
in O
a O
downwards O
spiral O
of O
insanity O
and O
paranoia. O
She O
only O
listens O
to O
the O
ramblings O
of O
a O
radio-evangelist, O
fears O
that O
she O
will O
be O
punished O
for O
the O
crimes O
her O
son O
committed O
and O
slowly O
develops O
violent O
tendencies. O
The O
script, B-STORY
although O
not O
entirely O
without O
flaws, O
is O
well O
written O
and O
the O
film O
is O
adequately O
paced. O
There's O
never O
a O
dull B-TONE
moment O
in O
"What's O
the O
matter O
with O
Helen", O
although O
the O
singing, O
tap-dancing O
and O
tango O
sequences O
are O
quite O
extended O
and O
much O
unrelated B-FRANCHISE
to O
the O
actual O
plot. B-CLICHES
But O
the O
atmosphere O
is O
continuously O
ominous B-TONE
and O
the O
film O
definitely O
benefices O
from O
the O
terrific B-PERFORMANCE
acting B-CAST
performance B-CAST
of O
Shelley O
Winters. O
She's O
downright O
scary O
as O
the O
unpredictable O
and O
introvert O
lady O
who's O
about O
to O
snap O
any O
second O
and, O
especially O
during O
the O
last O
ten O
minutes O
or O
so, O
she O

more O
petrifying O
than O
all O
the O
Freddy O
Kruegers, O
Jason O
Voorhees' O
and O
Michael O
Myers' O
combined! O
There O
are O
several O
terrific B-PERFORMANCE
supportive O
characters B-CAST
who O
are, O
sadly, O
a O
little O
underdeveloped O
and O
robbed O
from O
their O
potential, O
like O
Michéal O
MacLiammóir O
as O
the O
cocky O
elocution O
teacher, O
Agnes O
Moorehead O
as O
the O
creepy O
priestess O
and O
Timothy O
Carey O
as O
the O
obtrusive O
visitor O
to O
the O
ladies' O
house. O
There O
are O
a O
couple O
of O
surprisingly O
gruesome O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
and O
moments O
of O
genuine O
shock O
to O
enjoy O
for O
the O
Grand O
Guignol O
fanatics O
among O
us, O
but O
particularly O
the O
set O
pieces O
and O
costume O
designs O
(even O
nominated O
for O
an O
Oscar!) B-PERFORMANCE
are O
breathtaking. O

Resnais, O
wow! O
The O
genius O
who O
brought O
us O
Hiroshima O
Mon O
Amour O
takes O
on O
the O
challenge O
of O
making O
a O
1930s O
French O
musical B-REMAKES
in O
vibrant B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
colour. O
The O
opening O
voice-over O
with O
old, O
embellished O
inter-titles O
was O
a O
nice O
touch. O
Then O
the O
camera B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
aperture O
opens O
(like O
the O
old O
hand O
crankers) O
on O
a O
black B-HUMOR
& O
white O
placard. O
The O
camera B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
backs O
off O
(or O
rather, O
up), O
suddenly O
showing O
us O
the O
surprisingly O
brilliant O
colours O
of O
an O
elegant O
table O
set O
for O
a O
tea O
party. O
This O
is O
all O
in O
the O
first O
60 O
seconds.<br O
/><br O
/>Then O
the O
music B-MUSIC
starts. O
A O
rather O
banal O
and O
forgettable B-PERFORMANCE
diddy O
featuring O
an O
unconvincing B-PERFORMANCE
chorus O
of O
3 O
girls O
blabbering O
some O
nonsense O
which O
has O
no O
relevance O
to O
the O
film O
(and O
yes, O
I O
speak O
French, O
so O
I O
can't O
blame O
it O
on O
the O
subtitles). O
Those O
characters B-CAST
whiz O
out O
the O
door O
and O
are O
replaced O
by O
more O
people O
who O
break O
into O
an O
even O
more O
forgettable B-PERFORMANCE
song. O
Then O
they O
leave, O
and O
finally O
Audrey O
Tautou O
appears O
and O
we O
hear O
our O
first O
appreciable O

15 O
minutes O
into O
the O

/><br O

not O
sure O
what O
Resnais O
intended O
by O
starting O
off O
with O
such O
a O
yawning O
waste O
of O
time O
& O
musical B-REMAKES
cacophony. O
But O
the O
effect O
on O
the O

is O
to O
make O
you O
want O
to O
hurl O
skittles O
at O
the O

storm O
out. O
I O
endured.<br O

I'll O
tell O

There O
is O
absolutely O
no O

We O
don't O
even O

too O
intent O
on O
showing O
off O

only O
thing O
that O
kept O

watching O

long O

did O
(1 O

Maybe O
tomorrow O

I'm O
sure O
you O
do, O

Skip O
this. O

I O
saw O
this O
movie O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night, B-STORY
when O
I O
was O
flipping O
through O

there O
was O
nothing O
else O
on O

watch. O
It's O
one O
of O
those O
films O
where O
you O
stop O
to O
see O
what O
it O
is O
- O
just O
for O
a O
moment! O
- O
but O
realize O
after O
twenty O
minutes O
or O
so O
that O
you O
just O
can't O
turn O
it O
off, O
no O
matter O
how O
bad O
it O
is. O
One O
of O
those O
movies O
that O
is O
somewhere O
in O
between O
being O
so O
bad O
it's O
good B-CAST
and O
so O
bad O
it's, O
well, O
just O
plain O
BAD, O
it's O
worth O
seeing O
just O
to O
experience O
the O
confusion O
of O
realizing O
that O
it's O
both! O
Great O
middle-of-the-night O
fare, O
if O
only O
for O
the O
fabulous O
tennis O

Don't O
even O
bother O
asking O
yourself O
why O
nobody O
can O
tell O
that O
Chad O
Lowe O
is O
so O
obviously O
male, O
because O
logic O
does O
not O

This O
movie O
takes O
the O
plot B-CLICHES
behind O
the O
sci-fi B-GENRE
flick O
"Doppelganger" O
(an O
astronaut O
from O
our O
Earth O
crashing O
on O
a O

However, O
the O

is O
probably O
better O
off O
for O
it.<br O
/><br O

here O
is O
perfectly O
adequate O
in O
a O
'made O

way. O
Cameron O
Mitchell O

in O
his O
usual O
solid O

So O
does O
Glenn O

(who O
seems O
to O

/><br O
/>But O
the O
low O
budget O
and O
low O
energy O

inconsistent O
script B-STORY

of O
any O
real O

keep O
this O
Sci-Fi B-GENRE
adventure B-GENRE
firmly O
tethered O
on O
the O
launch O
pad.<br O
/><br O
/>I'll O
give O
one O
example: O
in O
the O
original O
template O
for O
this O
pilot, O
("Doppleganger"), O
the O
astronauts O
lose O
control O
of O
their O
landing O
vehicle O
in O
a O
thunderstorm, O
and O
crash O
their O
ship O
in O
a O
truly O
appalling O
sequence O
(it O
was O
obvious O
that O
their O
ship O
was O
never O
going O
to O
fly O
again). O
Then O
the O
two O
astronauts O
stagger O
helplessly O
from O
the O
smoking O
remains O
of O
their O
vehicle O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
howling O
rains O
and O
winds, O
only O
to O
be O
smacked O
down O
and O
overcome O
by O
faceless O
men O
yelling O
through O
loudspeakers.<br O
/><br O
/>In O
"Stranded O
in O
Space", O
the O
astronauts O
are O
sitting O
in O
their O
seats O
when O
buzzers O
sound, O
things O
start O
shaking, O
and O
the O
camera B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
blurs O
into O
a O
blackout O
(and O
as O
a O
friend O
pointed O
out, O
it O
was O
pretty O
obvious O
that O
the O
actors O
were O
simply O
shaking O
themselves O
on O
their O
seats, O
the O
director B-DIRECTION
wasn't O
even O
shaking O
the O
camera B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
or O
the O
set). O
I've O
seen O
episodes O
of O
"The O
Twilight O
Zone" O
and O
"The O
Outer O
Limits" O
that O
took O
more O
effort O
to O
establish O
mood O
and O
setting O
than O
this O
made-for-TV O
mediocrity.<br O
/><br O
/>And O
that, O
in O
essence, O
is O
what's O
wrong O
with O
"Stranded O
In O
Space". O
No O
budget, O
no O
time, O
no O
imagination...just O
making O
the O
token O
gestures O
and O
hoping O
the O
sci-fi B-GENRE
Fan O
Boys' O
imagination O
and O
enthusiasm O
will O
fill O
in O
the O
rest. O
Sorry, O
guys, O
it O
didn't O
work. O
<br O
/><br O
/>I'm O
sure O
that O
everyone O
here O
just O
finished O
their O
work O
on O
this O
one O
and O
walked O
away, O
and O
never O
thought O
of O
it O
again, O
except O
as O
a O
listing O
on O
their O
C.V. O
And O
that's O
what O
you, O
the O
viewer O
will O
do. O
You'll O
remember, O
if O
pressed, O
that O
you O
once O
watched O
a O
TV O
movie O
called O
"Stranded O
In O
Space", O
but O
it O
made O
no O
lasting O
impression O
on O
you, O
and O
you O
can't O
recall O
too O
much O
about O
it. O

Black B-HUMOR
comedy B-GENRE
isn't O
always O
an O
easy O
sell. O
Every O
now O
and O
then O
you O
get O
a O
black B-HUMOR
comedy B-GENRE
that O
is O
hugely O
successful, O
like O
Fargo, O
for O
example. O
But O
usually O
they O
don't O
often O
find O
big O
audiences. O
People O
seem O
to O
either O
set O
their O
minds O
for O
comedy, B-GENRE
or O
for O
serious O
mayhem. O
There O
doesn't O
seem O
to O
be O
a O
big O
market O
for O
a O
good B-CAST
mixture O
of O
both. O
Throw O
Momma O
From O
the O
Train O
was O
a O
fairly O
decent O
hit, O
yet O
few O
people O
seem O
to O
remember O
much O
about O
it O
in O
this O
day O
and O
age. O
Danny O
DeVito B-CAST
just O
about O
hit O
this O
one O
all O
the O
way O
out O
of O
the O
park O
back O
in O
1987.<br O
/><br O
/>DeVito B-CAST
plays O
an O
odd O
mamma's O
boy O
named O
Owen O
looking O
to O
rid O
himself O
of O
his O
outrageously O
overbearing O
and O
unpleasant O
mother O
whom O
he O
still O
lives O
with. O
The O
mother O
is O
played O
by O
Anne O
Ramsey, O
who O
passed O
away O
shortly O
after O
this O
was O
released, O
and O
she O
is O
quite O
a O
caricature. O
She O
is O
loud, O
ugly, O
rude, O
and O
overbearing. O
Though O
Owen O
hardly O
seems O
like O
he O
could O
take O
care O
of O
himself, O
he O
wants O
desperately O
to O
have O
his O
mother O
offed. O
He O
fantasizes O
about O
it O
in O
some O
truly O
weird O
scenes, B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
but O
he O
clearly O
doesn't O
have O
the O
guts O
to O
actually O
do O
it O
himself. O
That's O
where O
Billy O
Crystal O
comes O
in. O
Crystal O
plays O
Larry O
Donner, O
Owen's O
creative B-DIRECTION
writing B-STORY
teacher O
at O
a O
nearby O
community O
college. O
Larry O
is O
a O
paranoid O
would-be O
intellectual O
novelist O
who O
claims O
his O
ex-wife O
stole O
his O
novel O
and O
made O
millions O
off O
it. O
He O
is O
currently O
trying O
to O
write O
a O
new O
one, O
but O
cannot O
even O
come O
up O
with O
a O
decent O
first O
sentence. O
"The O
night B-STORY
was...." O
Owen O
hears O
Larry O
wish O
his O
ex-wife O
were O
dead O
during O
an O
outburst O
at O
the O
school O
cafeteria. O
And O
borrowing O
the O
idea O
from O
Strangers O
on O
a O
Train, O
Owen O
decides O
to O
travel O
to O
Hawai'i O
and O
murder B-GENRE
Larry's O
ex-wife. O
Once O
it O
appears O
he O
has O
done O
so, O
he O
expects O
Larry O
to O
return O
the O
favor O
and O
kill O
his O
mother. O
The O
resulting O
action B-GENRE
is O
often O
quite O
funny, B-HUMOR
and O
even O
poignant. O
It's O
certainly O
never O
dull B-TONE
and O
often O
full O
of O
surprises.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
acting B-CAST
is O
exceptional, O
even O
if O
Ramsey O
was O
a O
bit O
over O
the O
top. O
Crystal O
is O
as O
good B-CAST
as O
he O
can O
be, O
and O
DeVito B-CAST
has O
always O
been O
undervalued O
as O
a O
performer. O
The O
film O
relies O
on O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
physical B-HUMOR
comedy B-GENRE
which O
usually O
works, O
often O
painfully O
so. O
The O
film O
makes O
use O
of O
some O
truly O
innovative O
editing B-DIRECTION
techniques O
in O
some O
scenes, B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
and O
the O
off-beat O
tone O
is O
truly O
refreshing. O
I O
have O
often O
been O
critical O
of O
the O
late O
1980s O
as O
being O
a O
time O
of O
artistic O
malaise O
and O
down O
right O
lazy O
film-making. O
Throw O
Momma O
From O
the O
Train O
takes O
chances. O
Both O
in O
how O
its O
characters B-CAST
are O
drawn O
as O
well O
as O
its O
general O
plot. B-CLICHES
How O
many O
comedies O
revolve O
around O
a O
son O

his O

The O
film O
isn't O
too O
long, O
and O
it O
is O
chock O
full O
of O
laughs. O
Writers O
are O
apt O
to O
find O
it O

really O
lengthy O
vacation O
around O
the O
Fourth O
of O
July O
- O
something O
like O
17 O
days O
off O
in O
a O
row O
what O
with O
two O
weeks O
paid O
vacation, O
weekends O
and O
the O
holiday B-GENRE
itself. O
I O
stayed O
in O
town O
during O
that O
time, O
hanging O
out O
at O
my O
parents' O
house O
a O
lot.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
didn't O
have O
a O
TV O
in O
my O
apartment O
so O
I O
used O
to O
watch O
my O
parents' O
tube. O
I O
had O
just O
finished O
watching O
a O
segment O
of O
the O
X O
Files O
when O
a O
program O
came O
on O
called O
Personal O
FX. O
I O
was O
hooked O
instantly. O
I O
had O
always O
been O
fascinated O
with O
items O
in O
our O
home O
that O
had O
come O
from O
my O
parents' O
family B-FRANCHISE
homes O
and O
through O
inheritances O
from O
relatives' O
estates, O
and O
often O
wondered O
about O
their O
history, O
value, O
etc.<br O
/><br O
/>After O
my O
long O
vacation, O
I O
used O
to O
go O
to O
my O
folks' O
house O
on O
my O
lunch-hours O
just O
to O
catch O
Personal O
FX.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
can O
remember O
one O
episode O
during O
which O
co-host O
Claire O
Carter B-CAST
announced O
that O
the O
New O
York O
apartment O
in O
which O
the O
series B-FRANCHISE
was O
filmed O
was O
being O
renovated O
and O
that O
once O
said O
renovations O
were O
complete O
that O
Personl O
FX O
would O
return O
to O
the O
air.<br O
/><br O
/>It O
never O
did! O
Personal O
FX O
was O
the O
first O
-and O
best O
- O
of O
the O
collectible O
shows. O
And O
it O
vanished O
from O
the O
air! O
Almost O
fifteen O
years O
later, O
I'm O
still O
sore.<br O

Paul O
Verhoeven's O
predecessor O
to O
his O
breakout B-PERFORMANCE
hit O
'Basic O
Instinct' O
is O
a O
stylish O
and O
shocking O
neo-noir O
thriller. B-GENRE
Verhoeven B-DIRECTION
has O
become O
known O
for O
making O
somewhat O
sleazy B-TONE
trash O
films, O
both O
in O
his O
native O
Holland O
and O
in O
America O
and O
this O
film O
is O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
why. O
The O
Fourth O
Man O
follows O
the O
strange O
story B-STORY
of O
Gerard O
Reve O
(played O
by O
Jeroen O
Krabbé); O
a O
gay, O
alcoholic O
and O
slightly O
mad O
writer O
who O
goes O
to O
Vlissingen O
to O
give O
a O
talk O
on O
the O
stories O
he O
writes. O
While O
there, O
he O
meets O
the O
seductive O
Christine O
Halsslag O
(Renée O
Soutendijk) O
who O
takes O
him O
back O
to O
her O
house O
where O
he O
discovers O
a O
handsome O
picture O
of O
one O
of O
her O
lovers O
and O
proclaims O
that O
he O
will O
meet O
him, O
even O
if O
it O
kills O
him.<br O
/><br O
/>Paul O
Verhoeven B-DIRECTION
twists B-STORY
the O
truth O
many O
times O
in O
this O
film, O
and O
that O
ensures O
that O
you O
never O
quite O
know O
where O
you O
are O
with O
it. O
Many O
of O
the O
occurrences O
in O
The O
Fourth O
Man O
could O
be O
what O
they O
appear O
to O
be, O
but O
they O
could O
easily O
be O
interpreted O
as O
something O
else O
entirely O
and O
this O
keeps O
the O
audience O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
their O
seats O
for O
the O
duration, O
and O
also O
makes O
the O
film O
work O
as O
this O
narrative B-STORY
is O
what O
it O
thrives O
on. O
Paul O
Verhoeven B-DIRECTION
is O
not O
a O
filmmaker O
that O
feels O
he O
has O
to O
restrain O
himself, O
and O
that O
is O
one O
of O
things O
I O
like O
best O
about O
him. O
This O
film O
features O
a O
very O
shocking O
scene O
that O
made O
me O
feel O
ill O
for O
hours O
afterwards O
(and O
that O
doesn't O
happen O
very O
often!). O
I O
wont O
spoil O
it O
because O
it O
needs O
the O
surprise O
element O
to O
work...but O
you'll O
see O
what O
I O
mean O
when O
you O
see O
the O
film O
(make O
sure O
you O
get O
the O
uncut O
version!). O
There O
is O
also O
a O
number O
of O
other O
macabre O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
that O
are O
less O
shocking O
than O
the O
one O
I've O
mentioned, O
but O
are O
lovely O
nonetheless; O
a O
man O
gets O
eaten O
by O
lions, O
another O
one O
has O
a O
pipe O
sent O
through O
his O
skull, O
a O
boat O
is O
smashed O
in O
half...lovely.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
acting B-CAST
in O
The O
Fourth O
Man O
isn't O
anything O
to O
write O
home O
about, O
but O
it's O
solid O
throughout. O
Jeroen O
Krabbé O
holds O
the O
audience's O
attention O
and O
looks O
the O
part O
as O
the O
drunken O
writer. O
It O
is O
Renée O
Soutendijk O
that O
impresses O
the O
most, O
though, O
as O
the O
femme O
fatale O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
tale. O
Her O
performance B-CAST
is O
what O
Sharon O
Stone B-CAST
would O
imitate O
nine O
years O
later O
with O
Basic O
Instinct, O
but O
the O
original O
fatale O
did O
it O
best. O
Paul O
Verhoeven's O
direction B-DIRECTION
is O
solid O
throughout O
as O
he O
directs O
our O
attention O
through O
numerous O
points O
of O
view, O
all O
of O
which O
help O
to O
create O
the O
mystery B-STORY
of O
the O
story. B-STORY
Verhoeven B-DIRECTION
has O
gone O
on O
to O
make O
some O
rubbish, O
but O
he O
obviously O
has O
talent O
and O
it's O
a O
shame O
that O
he O
doesn't O
put O
it O
to O
better O
use. O
Of O
all O
the O
Verhoeven B-DIRECTION
films O
I've O
seen, O
this O
is O
the O
best O
and O
although O
it O
might O
be O
difficult O
to O
come O
across; O
trust O
me, O
it's O
worth O
the O
effort. O

I O
accept O
that O
most O
50's O
horror B-GENRE
aren't O
scary O
by O
today's O
standards, O
but O
what O
the O
hell O
is O
this? O
When O
you O
see O
a O
title O
like O
this O
you O
expect O
to O
see O
blood O
and O
a O
blood O
thirsty O
beast. O
Instead O
we O
get O
no O
blood O
at O
all O
and O
a O
beast O
who O
either O
wants O
to O
take O
over O
the O
world O
or O
live O
in O
peace O
on O
Earth....yeah O
which O
is O
what O
the O
people O
wanted.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
overall O
story B-STORY
is O
fine O
with O
the O
astronaut O
coming O
back O
to O
life O
and O
being O
one O
with O
the O
beast....but O
the O
title O
really O
kills O
the O
movie. O
Night B-STORY
of O
the O
Beast O
would O
have O
made O
the O
fans O
more O
happy O
because O
there O
really O
isn't O
any O
blood O
to O
speak O
of.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
like O
how O
the O
50's O
movies O
had O
endings O
that O
left O
room O
for O
a O
sequel B-FRANCHISE
but O
wisely O
never O
made O
one. O
This O
movie O
isn't O
the O
worst O
i've O
ever O
seen O
but O
its O
almost O
up O
there.<br O
/><br O
/>2 O
out O
of O
10 O

Demon O
Wind O
is O
about O
as O
much O
fun B-PERFORMANCE
as O
breaking O
your O
legs. O
It O
is O
definitely O
an O
awful O
example O
of O
a O
film. O
So O
awful O
in O
fact O
that O
I O
don't O
even O
consider O
it O
a O
movie. O
I O
describe O
it O
more O
as O
a O
thing O
... O
a O
monstrous O
thing. O
A O
thing O
that O
must O
be O
stopped O
at O
all O
costs. O
My O
friends O
and O
I O
first O
discovered O
this O
... O
thing O
buried O
under O
a O
big O
box O
of O
video O
tapes O
at O
my O
friend's O
house. O
It O
was O
a O
late O
night B-STORY
and O
we O
had O
nothing O
better O
to O
do O
so O
we O
decided O
to O
watch O
some O
cheesy B-HUMOR
horror B-GENRE
movies O
(we O
unfortunately O
picked O
this O
one.) O
Well, O
during O
the O
90 O
minutes O
that O
this O
thing O
played O
we O
ended O
up O
laughing O
so O
hard O
that O
we O
almost O
threw O
up. O
The O
thing O
is O
literally O
pointless O
in O
every O
sense O
of O
the O
word. O
It's O
just O
a O
cheap, B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
poorly O
done O
rip-off O
of O
Evil O
Dead. O
The O
whole O
"story" B-STORY
seems O
to O
be O
nothing O
more O
than O
some O
guy O
wanting O
to O
knock O
off O
his O
friends O
by O
inviting O
them O
to O
an O
abandoned O
house O
and O
letting O
demons O
rip O
them O
to O
pieces. O
I O
have O
a O
bet O
that O
the O
writers O
were O
actually O
writing B-STORY
the O
story B-STORY
while O
it O
was O
being O
filmed. O
I've O
seen O
bad O
horror B-GENRE
movies O
before O
(Manos, O
Troll O
2, O
HOBGOBLINS!!!) O
(shudder) O
I O
would O
have O
to O
say O
that O
Demon O
Wind O
could O
definitely O
contend O
with O
any O
and O
all O
of O
these O
films O
on O
terms O
of O
sheer O
stupidity. O
Watch O
it O
only O
if O
you O
enjoy O
laughing O
at O
stupid O
films.<br O
/><br O
/>Fun B-PERFORMANCE
fact: O
This O
film O
is O
like O
a O
cockroach O
on O
steroids! O
Much O
like O
the O
ouija O
board, O
every O
time O
we O
try O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
it, O
it O
always O
seems O
to O
mysteriously O
reappear. O
Kind O
of O
scary O
huh? O

There O
is O
a O
difference O
between O
a O
"film," O
and O
a O
"movie." O
A O
film, O
regardless O
of O
quality, O
is O
ready O
for O
public O
consumption. O
A O
movie O
is O
what O
a O
group O
of O
friends O
gets O
together O
to O
make O
over O
the O
course O
of O
a O
weekend O
with O
a O
camcorder. O
In O
my O
time O
as O
a O
viewer, O
I O
have O
seen O
may O
examples O
of O
both.<br O
/><br O
/>On O
September O
19, O
I O
attended O
a O
screening O
of O
writer/director O
Jon O
Satejowski's O
"Donnybrook." O
Now O
having O
read O
the O
script B-STORY
and O
having O
seen O
two O
different O
cuts O
(a O
rough O
cut O
and O
the O
"finished" O
product) O
of O
this O
piece, O
I O
can O
safely O
say O
it O
is O
a O
movie. O
And O
a O
student B-GENRE
movie, O
at O
that. O
It O
is, O
for O
lack O
of O
a O
better O
word, O
competent, O
which O
is O
to O
say, O
the O
director B-DIRECTION
knew O
how O
to O
push O
record O
on O
a O
camera B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
and O
capture O
moving O
images. O
The O
visuals B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
are, O
for O
the O
most O
part, O
static O
and O
unimpressive, O
and O
dialog O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
are O
reduced O
to O
mostly O
long O
shots, B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
with O
little O
to O
no O
close O
up O
shots B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
to O
allow O
the O
audience O
to O
establish O
a O
relationship O
with O
the O
characters. B-CAST
I O
understand O
that O
this O
is O
a O
modestly O
budgeted O
film, O
but O
some O
visual B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
flair O
would O
have O
been O
appreciated, O
and O
it O
would O
have O
gone O
a O
long O
way O
toward O
keeping O
the O
audience O
interested.<br O
/><br O
/>Granted, O
there O
have O
been O
independent O
pictures O
that O
have O
shown O
that O
limited O
camera B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
work O
can O
be O
over O
come O
with O
well O
a O
well O
written, O
engrossing O
story B-STORY
and O
some O
sharp O
dialog. O
Steven O
Soderbergh's O
"sex, O
lies, O
and O
videotape" O
comes O
immediately O
to O
mind. O
This O
movie, O
however, O
has O
neither. O
The O
main O
story B-STORY
is O
weak O
and O
unfocused. O
If O
the O
main O
plot B-CLICHES
is O
Davie O
trying O
to O
mend O
his O
relationship O
with O
his O
father, O
then O
I O
feel O
this O
movie O
misses O
the O
point. O
What O
I O
got O
out O
of O
it O
is O
that O
Davie's O
main O
aspiration O
is O
to O
"change O
the O
face O
of O
rock O
'n' O
roll." O
However, O
we O
see O
very O
little O
activity O
on O
his O
part O
to O
show O
this. O
While O
there O
is O
one O
dream O
sequence O
at O
the O
beginning, O
and O
an O
impromptu O
performance B-CAST
of O
his O
at O
the O
end, O
all O
we O
seem O
to O
get O
are O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
of O
Davie O
listening O
to O
music B-MUSIC
or O
casually O
strumming O
a O
guitar. O
We O
are O
simply O
told O
that O
Davie O
has O
played O
a O
lot O
of O
gigs, O
but O
we O
never O
see O
him O
in O
full O
rock O
out O
mode. O
Next O
time, O
SHOW O
don't O
TELL O
the O
audience. O
Anyone O
who O
has O
taken O
a O
creative B-DIRECTION
writing B-STORY
class O
knows O
this. O
Also, O
Davie O
doesn't O
look O
like O
someone O
that O
would O
have O
been O
big O
in O
the O
glam O
rock O
era O
of O
the O
1970's; O
he O
looks O
like O
he'd O
be O
more O
comfortable O
in O
the O
early O
days O
of O
rock O
'n' O
roll, O
posing O
as O
James O
Dean's O
less O
talented O
brother. O
In O
the O
meantime, O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
movies O
events O
seem O
to O
happen O
at O
random O
to O
rather O
cliché O
characters, B-CAST
and O
story B-STORY
threads, O
that O
have O
little O

If O
I O
want O
to O
see O
a O

with O
this O

I O
will O
consider O
watching O
"Napolean O

again, O

I O
could O
barely O
make O
it O
through O
the O
first O

/><br O
/>As O
for O
the O
above O
mentioned O
dialog O
scenes, B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
I O
guess O
I O
should O
mention O
that O
they O
are O
few O
and O
extremely O
far O
between. O
Is O
it O
too O
much O
to O
ask O
for O
characters B-CAST
who O
do O
speak? O
I O
don't O
think O
it O
is. O
When O
the O
characters B-CAST
do O
speak, O
it O
is O
in O
short, B-CAST
choppy O
sentences; O
collections O
of O
oh O
so O
insightful O
questions, O
angered O
grunts O
or O
wildly O
over-the-top B-REMAKES
outbursts. O
These O
characters B-CAST
simply O
do O
not O
behave O
like O
normal, O
rational O
people. O
Working O
with O
material O
like O
this, O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
understand O
why O
there O
is O
only O
one O
good B-CAST
performance B-CAST
in O
the O
film, O
Al O
Hudson's, O
and O
that's O
just O
because O
he's O
doing O
a O
poor O
imitation O
of O
Sam O
Elliott O
for O
his O
time O
on O

A O
good B-CAST
director, B-DIRECTION
or O
at O
least O
one O
who O
is O
ready O
for O
the O
challenge O
of O
a O

would O
have O
been O

these O
problems O
and O
get O
the O
writer O
and O
camera B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
people O
to O
correct O
them. O
However, O
with O
Satejowski O
being O
so O
close O
to O
the O
material, O
he O
simply O
doesn't O
see O
them, O
or, O
if O
he O
does, O
he O
is O
unwilling O
to O
take O
the O
necessary O
steps O
to O
fix O
them O
because O
it'll O
hurt O

Being O
unable O
or O
unwilling O
to O
deal O
with O

in O
a O

is O
the O

the O

so O
downright O
ugly O
and O
unappealing. O
I O
am O
reminded O
that O
the O
70's O
was O
a O
bad O
decade O
for O
men's O
fashion O
and O
automobiles. O
And O
all O
the O
smoking-! O
If O
the O
plan O
was O
to O
cheapen O
the O
characters, B-CAST
it O
succeeded.<br O
/><br O
/>For O
a O
film O
to O
work O
(at O
least, O
in O
my O
simple O
estimation), O
there O
has O
to O
be O
at O
least O
ONE O
sympathetic O
character. O
Only O
Ned O
Beaty O
came O
close, O
and O
I O
could O
not O
wait O
for O
him O
to O
finish O
off O
Nicky. O
If O
a O
stray O
shot O
had O
struck O
Mikey, O
well, O
it O
may O
have O
elicited O
a O
shrug O
of O
indifference O
at O
the O
most.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
can't O
remember O
when O
I O
detested O
a O
film O
as O
strongly. O
I O
suppose O
I'm O
a O
rube O
who O
doesn't O
dig O
"art" B-GENRE
flicks. O
Oh, O
well. O

"Lost", O
"24", O
"Carnivale", O
"Desperate O
Housewifes"...the O
list O
goes O
on O
and O
on. O
These, O
and O
a O
bunch O
of O
other O
high-quality, O
shows O
proves O
that O
we're O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
golden O
age O
in O
television O
history. O
"Lost" O
is O
pure O
genius. O
Incredible O
layers O
of O
personal, O
and O
psychologically O
viable, O
stories, O
underscored O
by O
sublime O
cinematography B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
(incredible O
to O
use O
this O
word, O
when O
describing O
a O
TV-show), O
a O
killer O
score, B-MUSIC
great O
performances O
and O

Anyone O
who O
isn't O
hooked O
on O

are O
missing O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
creative B-DIRECTION
expressions O
in O
television O
ever. O
It O
may O
have O
its O
problems, O
when O
watching O
only O
one O
episode O
a O
week, O
but O
the O
DVD O
format O
is O
actually O
an O
incredible O
way O
to O
watch O
this. O
Hope O
they O
keep O
it O
up O
(as O
I'm O
sure O
they O
do). O

Clifton O
Webb O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorites. O
However, O
Mister O
Scoutmaster O
is O
not O
one O
of O
his O
best. O
His O
patented O
curmudgeon O
role O
seems O
forced B-CLICHES
and O
even O
unpleasant O
rather O
than O
funny. B-HUMOR
The O
film O
itself O
is O
overflowing O
with O
mawkish O
sentimentality. O
In O
addition, O
the O
viewer O
is O
presented O
with O
numerous O
ham-handed O
references O
to O
religious O
faith O
and O
U.S. O
patriotism O
that O
come O
off O
as O
over-reverent O
rather O
than O
genuine. O
Clifton O
Webb O
does O
his O
best O
with O
a O
poor O
script. B-STORY
Edmund O
Gwenn O
plays O
yet O
another O
jovial O
clergyman O
and O
is O
given O
nothing O
to O
do. O
The O
child O
actor B-CAST
lead O
is O
played O
by O
a O
talentless O
child O
who O
displays O
a O
flat O
affect O
throughout O
the O
entire O
film. O
His O
sole O
claim O
to O
fame O
as O
a O
performer O
evidently O
is O
a O
bullfrog-like O
low O
voice O
unusual O
for O
someone O
of O
his O
age. O
However, O
once O
you've O
heard O
it, O
you've O
heard O
it O
and O
you O
don't O
need O
to O
hear O
it O
again. O
Unfortunately, O
he O
is O
in O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
film's O
scenes. B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
I O
find O
this O
child O
so O
irritating O
that O
I O
fast O
forward O
whenever O
he O
shows O
up. O
Since O
he O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
in O
this O
film, O
this O
means O
that O
I O
fast O
forward O
through O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
film. O
There O
were O
and O
are O
so O
many O
talented O
child O
actors; O
it's O
a O
pity O
this O
film O
doesn't O
have O
any O
of O
them O
in O
it. O
Still, O
Clifton O
Webb O
in O
the O
traditional O
broad-brimmed O
hat O
and O
shorts O
is O
a O
sight O
worth O
seeing. O

This O
is O
a O
must-see O
documentary O
movie O
for O
anyone O
who O
fears O
that O
modern O
youth O
has O
lost O
its O
taste O
for O
real-life O
adventure B-GENRE
and O
its O
sense O
of O
morality. O
Darius O
Goes O

an O
amazing O
roller-coaster O
of O

So O
how O

The O
message O
of O
a O
world O
on O
the O
brink O
of O
war B-GENRE
is O
disregarded O
by O
the O
masses; O
the O
mythical O
city O
of O
Everytown O
in O
1940 O
represents O
England O
in O
general, O
but O
it O
could O
just O
as O
well O
stand O
for O
any O
nation O
of O
the O
world. O
When O
war B-GENRE
finally O
does O
arrive, O
it's O
ravages O
continue O
not O
for O
another O
five O
years, O
but O
until O
1966 O
at O
which O
time O
Everytown O
is O
completely O
destroyed. O
Adding O
to O
the O
desolation O
and O
toll O
on O
humanity O
is O
the O
"wandering O
sickness", O
a O
pestilence O
that O
continues O
for O
another O
four O
years.<br O
/><br O
/>"Things O
to O
Come" O
balances O
both O
a O
fatalistic O
and O
futuristic O
world O
view, O
where O
science O
holds O
out O
a O
hope O
for O
a O
revived O
civilization. O
The O
"Wings O
Over O
the O
World" O
concept O
plays O
out O
a O
bit O
corny, O
though O
it's O
spokesman O
Cabal O
(Raymond O
Massey) O
is O
unwavering O
in O
his O
mission O
and O
dedicated O
to O
his O
cause. O
If O
he O
fails, O
others O
will O
follow. O
This O
message O
is O
continually O
reinforced O
throughout O
the O
film, O
brought O
home O
convincingly O
in O
Massey's O
end O
of O
movie O
speech. O
Man's O
insatiable O
need O
to O
test O
the O
limits O
of O
knowledge O
and O
achievement O
requires O
an O
"all O
the O
universe B-FRANCHISE
or O
nothing" O
mindset.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
film's O
imagery O
of O
automation O
and O
machinery O
in O
the O
second O
half O
is O
reminiscent O
of O
the O
great O
silent B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
film O
"Metropolis". O
As O
Everytown O
is O
rebuilt O
and O
transformed O
by O
the O
year O
2036, O
the O
spectacle O
of O

strikes O
a O
resonant O
chord, O
as O

the O

but O
in O
1936, O

seemed O
more O
legitimate O
than O
1969.<br O

those O

not O

well O
horror-splatter-gore O

pretty O

I O
always O

Even O

ones O
where O

from O

really O
love O
to O
watch O
a O

this O

because O
the O

seem O
a O
little O

it's O
okay O

once O

you O
hardly O
even O
notice O
what O
is O
going O

I O
think O
it's O
got O
a O
good B-CAST

even O

I O
didn't O
really O
understand O
what O
was O
going O
on O
on O
my O
first O

I O
figured O
it O
out O
over O

that's O
the O
important O

important O

how O

WARNING: O
REVIEW O
CONTAINS O
MILD O
SPOILERS<br O
/><br O
/>A O
couple O
of O
years O
back O
I O
managed O
to O
see O
the O
first O
five O
films O
in O
this O
franchise, O
and O
was O
planning O
to O
do O
an O
overview O
of O
the O
whole O
Elm O
St. O
series. B-FRANCHISE
However, O
just O
two O
years O
on O
and O
I O
find O
I O
can't O
remember O
enough O
about O
them O
in O
order O
to O
do O
it O
 O
I O
guess O
they O
couldn't O
have O
made O
much O
of O
an O
impression. O
From O
what O
I O
do O
recall, O
some O
of O
the O
sequels O
 O
Dream O
Warriors O
in O
particular O
 O
weren't O
as O
bad O
as O
is O
often O
made O
out, O
though O
even O
the O
original O
was O
no O
classic. B-GENRE
Generally, O
the O
predictability O
of O
the O
premise O
(if O
people O
fall O
asleep O
they O
get O
murdered O
in O
their O
dreams) O
doesn't O
lend O
itself O
to O
narrative B-STORY
tension. O
But O
while O
I O
cannot O
recall O
much O
of O
the O
first O
five O
films, O
I O
do O
know O
they O
never O
plumbed O
the O
depths O
of O
Freddy's O
Dead.<br O
/><br O
/>An O
indication O
of O
how O
sick O
of O
Freddy O
the O
public O
was O
at O
this O
point O
can O
be O
judged O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
film O
was O
promoted O
solely O
on O
the O
character's B-CAST
demise. O
The O
fact O
that O
the O
movie's O
conclusion O
is O
not O
even O
hidden, O
but O
in O
fact O
the O
entire O
purpose O
for O
the O
film's O
being O
goes O
to O
illustrate O
how O
vacant, O
soulless B-TONE
and O
cynical B-HUMOR
this O
venture O
was.<br O
/><br O

the O
morally O
questionable O
idea O
of O
having O

villain, B-CLICHES
Robert O
Englund's O
in-no-way-scary O
interpretation O
booms O
with O
laughter. B-HUMOR
I O
always O
thought O
Freddy's O
mockery O
of O
the O
teenage O
victims O
was O
less O
aimed O
at O
the O
characters B-CAST
than O
at O
the O
teenage O
audience O
that O
could O
ever O
watch O
this O
tripe. O
It's O
like O
Englund's O
crying O
out O
"we O
know O
this O
is O
garbage O
 O
but O
you're O
paying O
to O
see O
it, O
so O
who's O
the O
one O
laughing?" O
And O
I'm O
sure O
victims O
of O
child O
abuse O
would O
be O
disheartened O
to O
see O
such O
an O
insensitive O
depiction O
of O
their O
plight. O
Was O
Freddy's O
appearance O
in O
the O
films O
always O
so O
rudimentary? O
All O
he O
gets O
to O
do O
here O
is O
a O
few O
"haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr O
 O
har O
 O
har O

and O
that's O
it. O
If O
this O
was O
the O
only O
Elm O
St. O
film O
you'd O
ever O
seen O
you O
wouldn't O
get O
to O
know O
the O
character O
at O
all. O
Even O
as O
the O
character O
pre-death O
in O
a O
flashback O
Englund O
plays O
him O
as O
a O
boo-hiss O
pantomime O
villain B-CLICHES
with O
a O
slop O
of O
Transatlantic O

not O

Only O

And O
when O

up, O
you O
can O
almost O
visibly O
see O
the O
film O
sinking O
further O
into O
the O
mire. O
The O
script, B-STORY

is O
absolutely O
lousy, O
almost O
wholly O
without O

Carlos O
(Ricky O

opens O
a O

upon O
which O
the O
Noel O
Coward-like O
Freddy O
has O
wittily O
written O
"you're O

When O
prompted O
for O
the O
map, O
Carlos O
responds O
"well O
the O

says O
we're O

how O
about O
the O
scene O
where O
Carlos O
is O
tortured O
by O
Freddy, O
his O

enhanced O
to O
painful O

So O
Freddy O
torments O
him O
by O
threatening O
to O
drop O
a O
pin O
 O
a O
potentially O
fatal O
sound, O
given O
that O
all O

are O
magnified. O
Oddly, O
the O
fact O
that O
Carlos O
shouts O
at O
the O
top O
of O
his O
voice O
for O
him O
not O
to O
drop O
it O

"Nice O

quips O
Freddy, O
hoping O
some O

It's O
also O
worth O
noting O
that O

out.<br O

movie O
is O
mader O
with O
one O
thing O
in O
mind: O
To O
depict O
brutal B-TONE
murders. B-STORY
Why, O
then, O
is O
not O
the O
little O
girl O
tortured O
and O
murdered O
as O
well? O
Will O
this O

next O
for O

The O
torture O

abuse O
of O

Whats O
wrong O
with O
you O
people? O
Lynch O
is O
truly O
has O
a O
disgusting, O
ugly O
mind. O

I O
can't O
say O
much O
about O
this O
film. O
I O
think O
it O
speaks O
for O
itself O
(as O
do O
the O
current O
ratings O
on O
here). O
I O
rented O
this O
about O
two O
years O
ago O
and O
I O
totally O
regretted O
it. O
I O
even O
/tried/ O
to O
like O
it O
by O
watching O
it O
twice, O
but O
I O
just O
couldn't. O
I O
can O
safely O
say O
that O
I O
have O
absolutely O
no O
desire O
to O
see O
this O
waste O
of O
time O
ever, O
ever O
again. O
And O
I'm O
not O
one O
to O
trash O
a O
movie, O
but O
I O
truly O
believe O
this O
was O
awful. O
It O
wasn't O
even O
funny B-HUMOR
in O
the O
slightest. O
The O
only O
bits O
I O
enjoyed O
were O
the O
few O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
with O
Christopher O
Walken O
in O
them. O
I O
think O
this O
film O
ruined O
both O
Jack O
Black B-HUMOR
and O
Ben O
Stiller O
for O
me. O
All O
I O
can O
think O
of O
when O
I O
see O
one O
of O
their O
films O
now-a-days O
is O
this O
terrible O
movie, O
and O
it O
reminds O
me O
not O
to O
waste O
my O
money. O
Amy O
Poehler O
is O
so O
very O
annoying, O
too.<br O
/><br O
/>Overall, O
well, O
I O
think O
you O
get O
my O
point. O
The O
stars O
are O
for O
Walken, O
by O
the O
way. O

I O
am O
not O
so O
old O
that O
I O
can't O
remember O
laughing O
at O
Bobcat O
Goldthwait O
a O
couple O
times. O
But O
some O
where O
in O
all O
his O
years O
of O
drug O
abuse O
he O
lost O
his O
sense O
of O
humor O
as O
well O
as O
his O
brain O
cells.<br O
/><br O
/>From O
the O
moment O
this O
film O
opens O
you O
can O
have O
no O
sympathy O
nor O
empathy O
for O
the O
female O

Neither O
will O
you O
find O
anything O
remotely O
funny B-HUMOR
after O
hearing O
the O
opening O
line. O
Goldthwait O
obviously O
hates O
himself O
so O
much O
that O
he O
needs O
to O
degrade O
in O
order O
to O
feel O
better- O
even O
if O
it O
is O

The O
box O
is O
why O
I O
originally O
picked O
up O
this O
movie O
and O
the O
back O
is O
why O
I O
rented O
it. O
But O
I O
soon O
learned O
that O
I O
had O
been O
duped. O
I O
had O
thought O
this O
movie O
would O
be O
something O
like O
a O
Road O
Trip/Eurotrip/American O
Pie O
deal. O
But O
I O
was O
wrong. O
This O
movie O
is O
one O
of O
the O
dumbest O
I've O
seen O
in O
a O
long O
time. O
The O
unrated O
version O
teases O
you O
in O
to O
watching O
but O
will O
completely O
disappoint O
you. O
The O
acting B-CAST
was O
terrible O
and O
sound O
effects O
just O
gaudy. O
It O
appeared O
very O
low O
budget O
with O
the O
entire O
setting O
taking O
place O
in O
the O
same O
building. O
Go O
out O
and O
get O
Eurotrip O
or O
Road O
Trip O
instead. O
I O
can't O
believe O
National O
Lampoon O
put O
its O
name O
on O
this. O
DON'T O
BUY O
IT, O
DON'T O
RENT O
IT. O
Don't O
waste O
2 O
hours O
of O
your O
life O
on O
this. O

There O
have O
been O
many O
documentaries O
that O
I O
have O
seen O
in O
which O
it O
appeared O
that O
the O
law O
was O
on O
the O
wrong O
side O
of O
the O
fence O
- O
The O
Thin O
Blue O
Line O
and O
Paradise O
Lost O
come O
to O
mind O
first O
and O
foremost. O
But O
this O
is O
the O
first O
film O
that O
had O
me O
seething O
with O
anger O
after O
I O
saw O
it. O
It O
seems O
blatantly O
clear O
to O
me O
from O
the O
evidence O
presented O
in O
this O
film O
that O
what O
happened O
at O
Waco O
was O
at O
the O
very O
least O
an O
unprofessional O
and O
sloppy O
mess O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
FBI O
and O
AFI, O
and O
at O
the O
very O
worst O
an O
act O
of O
murder. B-GENRE
Like O
most O
people, O
when O
the O
siege O
at O
Waco O
was O
occurring O
I O
assumed O
that O
David O
Koresh O
was O
a O
completely O
evil O
madman O
who O
was O
leading O
a O
violent O
cult. B-FRANCHISE
After O
seeing O
this, O
I O
think O
that O
Koresh O
was O
more O
likely O
a O
slightly O
unbalanced O
and O
confused O
guy O
who O
inadvertently O
caught O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
U.S. O
government O
through O
his O
eccentric O
actions. O
Sure, O
there O
were O
lots O
of O
weapons O
at O
the O
Branch O
Davidian O
compound. O
But O
none O
of O
it O
was O
illegal. O
It O
was O
absolutely O
heartbreaking O
to O
see O
the O
video O
footage O
of O
the O
people O
inside O
the O
compound, O
all O
of O
them O
seeming O
to O
be O
very O
nice O
and O
harmless. O
And O
it O
was O
angering O
to O
see O
the O
callous O
testimony O
of O
the O
men O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
government O
forces O
on O
the O
Waco O
site, O
the O
clueless O
testimony O
of O
Janet O
Reno, O
and O
the O
partisan O
defense O
of O
the O
attack O
on O
Waco, O
a O
defense O
led O
by O
a O
few O
of O
the O
committee O
Democrats. O
Standing O
out O
most O
in O
my O
mind O
was O
NY O
representative O
and O
current O
U.S. O
senator O
from O
NY O
Charles O
Schumer. O
I O
voted O
for O
the O
man O
when O
I O
lived O
in O
NY O
state O
- O
I'm O
a O
Democrat, O
pretty O
left-leaning O
too. O
After O
seeing O
his O
actions O
on O
this O
committee, O
I O
wish O
I O
could O
go O
back O
in O
time O
and O
vote O
for O
D'Amato O
instead! O
For O
anyone O
remotely O
interested O
in O
the O
government, O
this O
is O
a O
very O
crucial O
film, O
a O
must O
see. O
I O
even O
think O
this O
should O
be O
shown O
in O
classes O
- O
it's O
that O
important. O

I O
saw O
this O

last O
night B-STORY

thought O
it O
was O
decent. O

that O
this O
more O
often O
than O
not O
leads O
to O
complications O
makes O
for O
the O
dramatic O
content O
into O
which O
I O
will O
not O
go O
here.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
liked O
what O
this O
movie O
has O
to O
say O
about O
youth, O
about O
maturing O
and O
about O
the O
necessity O
to O
compromise. O
The O
movie O
I O
associate O
most O
with O
this O
one O
is O
Alfred O
Hitchcock's O
Shadow O
of O
a O
Doubt, O
it O
creates O
a O
similar O
atmosphere O
of O
idealized O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
caricatured O
Small O
Town O
America. O
The O
story B-STORY
has O
a O
certain O
similarity O
with O
Fritz O
Lang's O
considerably O
harsher O
movie O
Clash O
by O
Night, B-STORY
made O
one O
year O
earlier, O
where O
Stanywck O
stars O
in O
a O
similar O
part. O
I O
can O
also O
recommend O
it. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
know O
if O
anyone O
know O
how O
I O
can O
get O
a O
copy O
of O
the O
movie, O
"That's O
the O
way O
of O
the O
World". O
It's O
been O
about O
30 O
years O
since O
I've O
seen O
this O
movie, O
and O
I O
would O
like O
to O
see O
it O
again. O
Earth O
Wind O
& O
Fire O
transcend O
the O
nation O
globally O
with O
their O
inspirational B-MUSIC
music B-MUSIC
and O
themes. O
It O
was O
unfortunate O
that O
this O
group O
didn't O
take O
off O
like O
their O
counterparts O
in O
the O
early O
70's, O
but O
as O
previously O
stated, O
racial O
tension O
existed O
in O
the O
United O
States O
which O
prohibited O
equalized O
exposure O
for O
the O
African O
American O
musical B-REMAKES
groups. O
It O
is O
good B-CAST
to O
see O
that O
Earth O
Wind O
& O
Fire O
continuing O
their O
success. O
I O
would O
like O
to O
add O
this O
movie O
to O
my O
collection. O
Someone O
please O
help O
me O
if O
possible. O
Thank O
you O
for O
your O
attention. O
Milton O
Shaw O

I O
saw O
the O
movie O
"Hoot" O
and O
then O
I O
immediately O
decided O
to O
comment O
it. O
The O
truth O
is O
that O
NATURE O
needs O
protection O
from O
us O
because O
we O
are O
the O
dominant O
specie O
of O
this O
planet. O
Some O
people O
think O
that O
if O
they O
have O
money, O
they O
can O
do O
whatever O
they O
want O
to, O
which O
probably O
is O
like, O
but O
if O
they O
think O
about O
the O
future O
more O
then O
they O
think O
about O
themselves O
they O
would O
do O
something O
useful! O
This O
movie O
is O
not O
just O
about O
kids, O
this O
movie O
is O
showing O
us O
that O
the O
kids O
are O
usually O
the O
ones O
that O
care O
more O
about O
it O
then O
the O
adults O
do. O
When O
I O
was O
twelve, O
I O
saw O
some O
waterlilies O
and O
I O
knew O
they O
are O
protected O
by O
law O
and O
didn't O
even O
dare O
to O
touch O
them O
not O
fearing O
of O
the O
law, O
but O
fearing O
that O
I O
might O
harm O
them O
actually. O
(I O
am O
currently O
15) O
What O
so O
ever, O
the O
acting B-CAST
was O
great, O
the O
3 O
main O
characters B-CAST
are O
well O
interpreted O
and O
we O
all O
have O
to O
learn O
from O
them. O
I O
hope O
you O
all O
think O
about O
what O
you O
saw O
in O
that O
movie!!! O
and O
Enjoy! O

I O
had O
some O
reservations O
about O
this O
movie, O
I O
figured O
it O
would O
be O
the O
usual O
bill O
of O
fare O
--- O
a O
formula O
movie O
about O
Christmas. O
Being O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
heat O
wave O
in O
late O
June, O
we O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
shot O
anyway, O
maybe O
we O
would O
see O
some O
snow.<br O
/><br O
/>This O
movie O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
one O
laugh O
after O
another. O
Ben O
Affleck O
was O
believable B-PERFORMANCE
in O
his O
character, O
but O
the O
real O
star O
of O
this O
one O
is O
James O
Gandofini. O
He O
delivered O
his O
lines O
with O
a O
real O
wit O
about O
him O
and O
made O
a O
great O
"dad".<br O
/><br O
/>If O
you O
want O
to O
have O
an O
enjoyable O
couple O
of O
hours, O
definitely O
check O
this O
one O
out. O

When O
I O
first O
saw O
this O
film O
around O
6 O
months O
ago, O
I O
considered O
it O
interesting, O
but O
little O
more. O
But O
it O
stuck O
with O
me. O
That O
interest O
grew O
and O
grew, O
and O
I O
wondered O
whether O
my O
initial O
boredom O
and O
response O
had O
more O
to O
do O
with O
the O
actual O
VHS O
quality O
rather O
than O
the O
film O
itself. O
I O
purchased O
the O
Criterion O
DVD O
box O
set, O
and O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
I O
was O
right O
the O
second O
time. O
Alexander O
Nevsky B-DIRECTION
is O
a O
great O
film. O
It O
is O
rousing, O
and O
I'm O
sure O
it O
succeeded O
in O
its O
main O
aim: O
propaganda B-STORY
against O
the O
Germans.<br O
/><br O
/>That O
is O
the O
most O
common O
criticism O
against O
this O
film, O
and O
against O
Eisenstein, O
that O
it O
is O
merely O
propagandist O
and O
nothing O
else. O
It's O
untrue. O
He O
is O
an O
amazing O
film O
artist, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
whoever O
lived. O
By O
now, O
the O
world O
is O
far O
enough O
beyond O
Joseph O
Stalin O
to O
be O
able O
to O
watch O
Eisenstein's O
films O
as O
art. B-GENRE

Focus O
is O
another O
great O
movie O
starring O
William O
H. O
Macy. B-CAST
I O
first O
discovered O
Macy B-CAST
in O
Fargo O
and O
I've O
seen O
a O
few O
of O
his O
films O
and O
he O
hasn't O
yet O
deceived O
me. O
Macy B-CAST
is O
the O
archetypal O
"nice O
guy O
with O
something O
to O
hide". O
In O
Focus, O
he O
plays O
the O
role O
of O
Lawrence O
Newman, O
a O
loyal O
and O
hard-working O
stiff, O
who O
harbours O
his O
handicapped O
mother O
at O
home. O
The O
scene O
is O
set O
after O
World O
War B-GENRE
II, O
at O
the O
height O
of O
McCarthyism. O
Newman O
is O
the O
head O
of O
Human O
Resources O
for O
a O
company O
which O
is O
basically, O
anti-Semite. O
After O
he O
accidentally O
hires O
a O
woman O
of O
Jewish O
descent, B-STORY
he O
is O
asked O
to O
buy O
a O
pair O
of O
glasses, O
to O
improve O
his O
failing O
eyesight.<br O
/><br O
/>Unbelievably, O
the O
simple O
act O
of O
buying O
glasses O
has O
great O
repercussions O
on O
his O
life O
and O
that O
of O
Gertrude O
Hart, O
his O
wife O
(played O
by O
a O
great O
Laura O
Dern). O
As O
the O
film O
unravels, O
Newman O
will O
begin O
to O
see O
a O
whole O
different O
world, O
where O
being O
Jewish O
is O
akin O
to O
being O
an O
animal.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
movie O
is O
disturbing O
in O
the O
way O
it O
shows O
that O
being O
racist O
was O
something O
fairly O
normal. O
The O
chilling B-MUSIC
thought O
is O
that O
in O
some O
places, O
it O
probably O
still O
is. O

In O
"Brave O
New O
Girl," O
Holly B-CAST
comes O
from O
a O
small O
town O
in O
Texas, O
sings O
"The O
Yellow O
Rose O
of O
Texas" O
at O
a O
local O
competition, O
and O
gets O
admitted O
to O
a O
prestigious O
arts O
college O
in O
Philadelphia. O
From O
there O
the O
movie O
grows O
into O
a O
colorful O
story B-STORY
of O
friendship O
and O
loyalty. O
I O
loved O
this O
movie. O
It O
was O
full O
of O
great O
singing O
and O
acting B-CAST
and O
characters B-CAST
that O
kept O
it O
moving O
at O
a O
very O
nice O
pace. O
The O
acting B-CAST
was, O
of O
course, O
wonderful. O
Virginia O
Madsen B-CAST
and O
Lindsey O
Haun O
were O
outstanding, O
as O
well O
as O
Nick O
Roth O
The O
camera B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
work O
was O
really O
done O
well O
and O
I O
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
end O
(It O
seems O
a O
sequel B-FRANCHISE
could O
be O
in O
the O
making). O
Kudos O
to O
the O
director B-DIRECTION
and O
all O
others O
that O
participated O
on O
this O
production. O
Quite O
a O
gem O
in O
the O
film O
archives. O

Despite O
a O
totally O
misleading B-CLICHES
advertising O
campaign, O
this O
flick O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
an O
irritatingly O
clichéd, O
sub-par O
haunted B-GENRE
house O
flick O
with O
a O
totally O
implausible B-TONE
ending. O
Clue O
#1 O
for O
all O
considering O
seeing O
this O
turkey: O
Sam O
Raimi O
didn't O
direct O
it. O
Although O
commercials O
for O
the O
movie O
play O
up O
his O
involvement, O
in O
truth O
he O
is O
one O
of O
four O
producers. O
It's O
too O
bad O
that O
someone O
as O
talented O
as O
Raimi O
has O
allowed O
his O
name O
to O
be O
used O
in O
conjunction O
with O
such O
a O
poor O
movie. O
I O
don't O
think O
he O
would O
ever O
have O
directed O
something O
like O
this; O
that O
task O
was O
left O
to O
the O
Pang O
Brothers.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
screenplay O
for O
this O
film O
seems O
to O
have O
been O
cobbled O
together O
from O
numerous O
other O
"horror" B-GENRE
films, O
so O
you'll O
find O
absolutely O
zero O
original O
content O
in O
"The O
Messengers." O
What O
we O
get O
are O
a O
scene O
here O
and O
there O
that O
was O
plucked O
straight O
out O
of O
"Pulse," O
a O
couple O
that O
could O
have O
come O
from O
"The O
Birds," O
one O
or O
two O
from O
"The O
Others," O
etc. O
Nearly O
every O
scene, O
almost O
every O
line O
of O
dialogue, O
is O
one O
that O
has O
been O
lifted O
from O
any O
number O
of O
other O
movies. O
The O
whole O
thing O
makes O
for O
such O
a O
predictable B-CLICHES
movie O
that O
almost O
anyone O
will O
be O
able O
to O
figure O
out O
the O
"surprise O
ending" O
long O
before O
it O
comes.<br O
/><br O
/>Right O
about O
here O
would O
be O
a O
good B-CAST
time O
to O
point O
out O
that O
the O
advertising O
campaign, O
centered O
on O
the O
idea O
that O
only O
children O
can O
see O
ghosts, O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
this O
movie. O
In O
fact, O
everyone O
can O
see O
the O
ghosts. O
The O
teenage O
daughter O
and O
mother O
characters B-CAST
certainly O
see O
them, O
even O
quite O
early O
in O
the O
movie. O
I'm O
sure O
that O
whomever O
was O
in O
charge O
of O
marketing O
came O
up O
with O
this O
campaign O
because O
the O
film O
needed O
a O
unique O
angle O
to O
have O
any O
box O
office O
appeal, O
which O
otherwise O
is O
entirely O
absent. O
Now O
you O
know, O
so O
don't O
be O
fooled! O
Perhaps O
what O
this O
movie O
lacks O
most O
of O
all O
is O
anything O
resembling O
chemistry O
between O
the O
actors. O
It O
simply O
isn't O
there. O
All O
of O
the O
interactions O
come O
across O
as O
awkwardly O
stilted. B-PERFORMANCE
Coupled O
with O
the O
hackneyed O
story B-STORY
and O
ridiculous B-TONE
plot B-CLICHES
holes B-STORY
(just O
what O
is O
a O
guy O
who O
murdered O
his O
whole O
family B-FRANCHISE
doing O
still O
lurking O
around O
the O
small O
town O
where O
the O
murder B-GENRE
happened, O
anyhow? O
Didn't O
anyone O
think O
to O
maybe O
arrest O
him?), O
it O
all O
adds O
up O
to O
a O
profoundly O
unsatisfying O
ghost O
flick O
that O
only O
manages O
to O
surprise O
anyone O
over O
the O
age O
of O
ten O
with O
cheap B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
shots: B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
loud O
noises, O
visual B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
flashes, O
and O
anything O
short B-CAST
of O
a O
sheeted O
figure O
jumping O
out O
of O
a O
closet O
and O
yelling O
"Boo!" O
All O
we O
get O
for O
our O
buck O
this O
time O
around O
is O
yet O
another O
poorly-made O
film O
about O
spirits O
attempting O
to O
warn O
people O
away O
from O
a O
house. O
If O
there's O
any O
message O
that O
"The O
Messengers" O
delivers, O
it's O
"Don't O
waste O
your O
time O
on O
this O
movie." O

This O
movie O
sucks O
ass. O
Something O
about O
a O
heatwave O
in O
some O
European O
country, B-MUSIC
complete O
trash. O
There's O
nothing O
going O
for O
this O
movie O
whatsoever. O
maybe O
30 O
seconds O
of O
sex O
but O
that's O
it. O
There O
is O
a O
very O
annoying O
chick O
who O
hitches O
rides O
with O
people O
and O
really O
pisses O
me O
off. O
This O
movie O
is O
complete O
rash O
and O
you O
shouldn't O
subject O
yourself O
to O
watching O
it. O
I O
regret O
it O
it's O
very O
boring. B-TONE
I O
would O
rate O
it O
zero O
but O
i O
can't. O
No O
body O
in O
their O
right O
mind O
should O
see O
this. O
i'm O
sure O
you'll O
regret O
it O
completely O
i O
did. O
How O
could O
they O
think O
up O
something O
this O
bad. O
Even O
Mystery B-STORY
men O
was O
better. O
MYSTERY B-STORY
MEN. O
That O
sucks. O
That O
movie O
wasn't O
worth O
being O
made. O
complete O
waste O
of O
time. O
The O
characters B-CAST
in O
this O
are O
very O
hard O
to O
understand O
and O
i O
good B-CAST
very O
very O
very O
bored. O

I O
was O
looking O
forward O
to O
The O
Guardian, O
but O
when O
I O
walked O
into O
the O
theater O
I O
wasn't O
really O
in O
the O
mood O
for O
it O
at O
that O
particular O
time. O
It's O
kind O
of O
like O
the O
Olive O
Garden O
- O
I O
like O
it, O
but O
I O
have O
to O
be O
in O
the O
right O
mindset O
to O
thoroughly O
enjoy O
it.<br O
/><br O
/>I'm O
not O
exactly O
sure O
what O
was O
dampening O
my O
spirit. O
The O
trailers O
looked O
good, B-CAST
but O
the O
water O
theme B-MUSIC
was O
giving O
me O
bad O
flashbacks B-CLICHES
to O
the O
last O
Kevin O
Costner B-CAST
movie O
that O
dealt O
with O
the O
subject O
- O
Waterworld. O
Plus, O
despite O
the O
promise O
Ashton O
Kutcher B-CAST
showed O
in O
The O
Butterfly O
Effect, O
I'm O
still O
not O
completely O
sold O
on O
him. O
Something O
about O
the O
guy O
just O
annoys O
me. O
Probably O
has O
to O
do O
with O
his O
simian O
features.<br O
/><br O
/>It O
took O
approximately O
two O
minutes O
for O
my O
fears O
to O
subside O
and O
for O
my O
hesitancies O
to O
slip O
away. O
The O
movie O
immediately O
throws O
us O
into O
the O
midst O
of O
a O
tense O
rescue B-STORY
mission, O
and O
I O
was O
gripped O
tighter O
than O
Kenny O
Rogers' O
orange O
face O
lift. O
My O
concerns O
briefly O
bristled O
at O
Kutcher's O
initial O
appearance O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
too O
much O
effort O
was O
made O
to O
paint O
him O
as O
ridiculously O
cool B-MUSIC
and O
rebellious. O
Sunglasses, O
a O
tough O
guy O
toothpick O
in O
his O
mouth, O
and O
sportin' O
a O
smirk O
that'd O
make O
George O
Clooney O
proud? O
Yeah, O
we O
get O
it. O
I O
was O
totally O
ready O
to O
hate O
him.<br O
/><br O
/>But O
then O
he O
had O
to O
go O
and O
deliver O
a O
fairly O
strong O
performance B-CAST
and O
force O
me O
to O
soften O
my O
jabs. O
<br O
/><br O

you, O
ape O

Efficiently O

The O
Guardian O
is O
easily O
a O
film O
that O
I O
dare O
say O
the O
majority O
of O
audiences O
will O
enjoy. O
You O
can O
quibble O
about O
its O
clichés, O
predictability, O
and O
rare O
moments O
of O
overcooked O
sappiness, O
but O
none O
of O
that O
takes O
away O
from O
the O
entertainment O
value.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
had O
a O
bad O
feeling O
that O
the O
pace O
would O
slow B-TONE
too O
much O
when O
Costner B-CAST
started O
training O
the O
young O
guys, O
but O
on O
the O
contrary, O
the O
training O
sessions O
just O
might O
be O
the O
most O
interesting O
aspect O
of O
the O

Swimmers O
are O
heroes O
whose O
stories O
have O
never O
really O
been O
portrayed O
on O

so O
I O
feel O
the O
inside O
look O
at O
what O
they O
go O
through O
and O
how O
tough O
it O
is O
to O
make O
it O
is O
very O
informative O

a O
great O
way O
to O
introduce O
audiences O
to O
this O
under-appreciated O
group.<br O

you O
have O
what O
it O
takes O
to O
be O
a O

Just O
think O
about O
it O
-you O
get O
to O
go O
on O
dangerous O
missions O
in O
cold, O
dark, B-HUMOR
rough O
water, O
and O
then O
you O
must O
fight B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
disorientation, O
exhaustion, O
hypothermia, O
and O
a O
lack O
of O

all O
while O
trying O
to O
help O
stranded, O
panicked O
people O
who O
are O
depending O
on O
you O
for O
their O
survival. O
And O
if O
all O
that O
isn't O
bad O
enough, O
sometimes O
you O
can't O
save O
everybody O
so O
you O
have O
to O
make O
the O
tough O
decision O
of O
who O
lives O
and O
who O
dies.<br O
/><br O
/>Man, O
who O
wants O
all O
that O
responsibility? O
Not O
me! O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
it O
was O
really O
like O
for O

who O

I'd O
have O
an O

does O
The O

to O
this O
rare O
breed O
of O

lucky O
for O
us O
it O
also O
does O

embark O
on O
a O
daring O

in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O

might O
want O
to O
give O
The O

a O
chance. O
I O
saw O
it O
for O
free, O

had O
I O
paid O
I O
would've O
felt O
I O
had O
gotten O
my O
money's O
worth. O

Going O
into O
see O
Seven O
Pounds O
i O
wasn't O
clearly O
sure O
what O
to O
think O
because O
the O
previews O
left O
to O
much O
open O
to O
grasp O
what O
the O
movie O
was O
really O
about. O
So O
within O
the O
first O
20 O
min O
or O
so O
you O
are O
completely O
lost O
in O
the O
plot, B-CLICHES
have O
no O
idea O
what O
is O
going O
on O
and O
you O
think O
Tim, O
who O
claims O
to O
be O
Ben, O
is O
just O
a O
big O
asshole. O
All O
of O
this O
comes O
to O
an O
end O
when O
the O
"twist",so O
to O
speak, O
is O
unraveled O
at O
the O
very O
last O
minute O
of O
the O
movie. O
Basically O
Tim O
(will O
smith) O
was O
troubled O
and O
haunted B-GENRE
by O
a O
big O
accident B-STORY
he O
made O
causing O
the O
end O
of O
seven O
peoples O
lives. O
By O
this O
he O
decides O
to O
scope O
out O
seven O
new O
people O
who O
are O
in O
need O
of O
help O
badly O
who O
he O
in O
turns O
gives O
his O
life O
to.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
acting B-CAST
of O
this O
film O
is O
great, O
as O
i O
feel O
will O
smith O
no O
matter O
what O
part O
he O
seems O
to O
impress. O
Rosario O
Dawson, B-CAST
to O
me, O
this O
is O
one O
of O
her O
better O
movies, O
aside O
from O
eagle O
eye O
which O
i O
think O
is O
up O
there O
to. O
She O
has O
been O
in O
some O
bad O
some O
good B-CAST
but O
she O
does O
deliver O
in O
this O
film. O
Other O
actors, O
such O
as O
woody O
Harrelson, B-CAST
have O
very O
small O
roles O
and O
not O
a O
big O
enough O
role O
to O
grasp O
the O
character. O
Although O
the O
casting O
of O
the O
film O
was O
still O
good.<br O
/><br O
/>This O
movie O
was O
definitely O
not O
what O
i O
expected O
and O
certainly O
a O
lot O
slower O
pace O
in O
which O
i O
hoped. O
The O
movie, O
however, O
was O
still O
pretty O
good. B-CAST
Nothing O
is O
revealed O
until O
the O
last O
5 O
min O
of O
the O
movie O
and O
everything O
falls O
into O
place. O
Up O
until O
then O
it O
just O
seems O
like O
a O
pointless O
love O
story. B-STORY
Final O
thought O
seven O
pounds=seven O
Stars. O

I O
saw O
Brother's O
Shadow O
at O
the O
Tribeca O
Film O

and O
loved O
it! O
Judd O
Hirsch B-CAST
and O
Scott O
Cohen B-CAST
are O
great O
as O
father O
and O
son. O
The O
film O
follows O
Scott O
Cohen B-CAST
from O
parole O
in O
Alaska O
back O
to O
his O
family B-FRANCHISE
in O
Brooklyn. B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
He O
shows O
up O
there O
because O
his O
brother O
has O
died, O
and O
he O
embarks O
on O
a O
journey B-STORY

slowly O
repair O

estranged B-STORY
relationships O
with O
his O

has O
never O
forgiven O
him O
for O
being O
the O
black B-HUMOR
sheep O
of O
the O
family. B-FRANCHISE
The O
story B-STORY
takes O
us O
deep O
into O
the O
hearts O
and O
minds O
of O
this O
family B-FRANCHISE
and O
allows O
you O
to O
more O
deeply O
understand O
the O
complexity O
of O
their O
lives. O
Also, O
the O
imagery O
of O
the O
woodworking O
business O
and O
the O
Brooklyn B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
backdrop O
sets O
the O
tone O
for O
this O
rich B-CLICHES
and O
revealing O
family B-FRANCHISE
portrait. O

"Mararía" O
really O
disappointed O
me. O
I O
can't O
consider O
it O
as O
a O
bad O
movie, O
but O
the O
development O
just O
seemed O
too O
rushed O
and O
non-believable O
for O
it O
to O
evoke O
any O
emotions. O
Dr. O
Fermín O
displays O
some O
unprecedented O
bizarre O
behaviour O
out O
of O
a O
passion O
that O
one O
can't O
really O
understand O
where O
it O
was O
born O
from. O
I O
mean, O
how O
many O
times O
does O
he O
ever O
have O
a O
conversation O
with O
Mararía?? O
Maybe O
once? O
Also, O
Mararía O
never O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
real O
character, O
instead O
more O
like O
a O
film O
stereotype O
that O
just O
needed O
to O
be O
in O
the O
movie O
(...or O
else O
another O
title O
was O
needed?). O
Some O
of O
the O
best O
acting B-CAST
came O
from O
a O
role O
that O
wasn't O
really O
important O
to O
the O
story, B-STORY
that O
of O
Marcial, O
the O
sub-intelligent O
yet O
humble O

Of O

the O

the O
cultural O
tidbits O
of O
the O
Canary O

and O
other O
"wow" O
moments O
were O
interesting, O
but O
the O

fell O
short B-CAST
of O
a O
documentary O
(in O
case O
this O
was O
its O
real O

and O
most O
importantly, O

cure O
all O

little O
camera B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
movement O
aside O
from O
a O
storm O
sequence. O
Hecht O
and O
Macarthutr O
cared O
about O
one O
thing O
-- O
getting O
their O
dialogue O
on O

(NOTE: O

blink-and-you'll-miss-'em O
cameos O

in O

/><br O

most O
notable O
supporting O
player O
is O
the O
one O
and O
only O
Alexander O
Woolcott, O
notorious O
Broadway O
columnist O
and O
close O
friend O
of O
both O
Macarthur O

who O
appears O
as O
one O
of O
the O
bitchy O
authors O
always O
kept O
waiting O
in O
the O
reception O
room O
of O
publisher O
Coward.<br O
/><br O
/>Curious O
that O
Woolcott O
would O
agree O
to O
do O
a O
film O
that O
clearly O
lampoons O
the O
legendary O
Algonquin O

of O
which O
he O
was O
a O

Scoundrel O
actually O
won O
an O
Oscar B-PERFORMANCE
for O
best O

though O
that O
victory O
is O
probably O
due O
more O
to O
Coward's O
imposing O
presence O
than O
any O
brilliance O
in O
the O
plot. B-CLICHES
It's O
Coward, O
Woolcott, O
and O
the O
dialogue O
you O
remember... O

This O
is O
definitely O
a O
"must O
see" O
film. O
The O
excellent O
Director B-DIRECTION
Alain O
Chabat O
(also O
acting B-CAST
as O
Ceasar) O
has O
managed O
to O
capture O
the O
very O
essence O
of O
the O
"Adventures O
of O
Astérix" O
(the O
French O
comic B-HUMOR
books O
it's O
based O
upon) O
and O
to O
create O
a O
fantastically O
modern O
and O
intelligent O
comedy, B-GENRE
which O
is O
also O
an O
homage O
to O
the O
world O
of O
animated O
films. O
This O
movie O
is O
so O
funny, B-HUMOR
so O
full O
of O
jokes O
(both O
visual B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
and O
spoken) O
that O
it O
might O
take O
you O
two O
or O
three O
screenings O
before O
you O
notice O
them O
all, O
between O
your O
bursts O
of O
laughter. B-HUMOR
The O
only O
drawback O
is O
that O
a O
non-French O
audience O
(or O
at O
least O
a O
non-French O
speaking O
audience) O
might O
not O
get O
all O
the O
"private O
jokes". O
There O
are O
so O
many O
dialogues O
impossible O
to O
translate, O
so O
many O
situations O
directly O
related O
either O
to O
the O
comic B-HUMOR
books O
or O
to O
the O
French O
way O
of O
life, O
that O
the O
fun B-PERFORMANCE
might O
be O
lessened. O
However, O
it's O
still O
totally O
worth O
seeing O
for O
the O
beautiful O
picture, O
the O
amazing O
stunts, B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
the O
music, B-MUSIC
the O
totally O
crazy O
atmosphere O
and O
the O
excellent O
acting. B-CAST
All O
actors O
are O
great, O
but O
the O
film O
would O
not O
be O
the O
same O
without O
Jamel O
Debouze, O
Gérard O
Darmon O
and O
Edouard O
Baer. O
And O
please O
don't O
EVER O
compare O
this O
magnificent O
film O
to O
the O
terrible O
previous O
one O
based O
on O
the O
same O
comic B-HUMOR
books O
: O
"Astérix O
et O
Obélix O
Contre O
César" O
and O
directed O
by O
Claude O
Zidi. O

I O
thought O
this O
movie O
was O
stunning, O
with O
completely O
outstanding O
performances O
by O
Valentina O
Cervi B-CAST
(Artemisia O
Gentileschi).<br O
/><br O
/>Cervi B-CAST
portrays O
Artemisia O
so O
beautifully, O
with O
tentative O
yet O
confidant O
mannerisms, O
her O
hands O
mapping O
out O
an O
idea O
before O
moving O
her O
models O
into O
place. O
The O
passion O
to O
which O
Artemisia O
gives O
to O
her O
art B-GENRE
is O
just O
spectacular O
to O
watch.<br O
/><br O
/>Although O
not O
each O
character O
was O
overtly O
beautiful, O
this O
made O
the O
film O
more O
realistic O
as O
the O
facial O
hair O
and O
clothing O
was O
perfect O
for O
that O
point O
in O
time.<br O
/><br O
/>Overall O
i O
thought O
this O
film O
was O
fantastic. O

I O
consider O
myself O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
connoisseur O
of O
boxing O
movies O
and O
as O
such O
there O
is O
only O
one O
thing O
that O
prevents O
me O
from O
calling O
"Gentleman O
Jim" O
the O
best O
boxing O
movie O
ever O
made. O
That O
is O
the O
Robert O
Wise/Paul O
Newman O
flick O
"Somebody O
Up O
There O
Likes O
Me." O
That O
movie O
might O
be O
number O
1, O
but O
"Gentleman O
Jim" O
is O
a O
close O
number O
2.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
movie O
doesn't O
just O
chronicle O
the O
rise O
of O
James O
J. O
Corbett, O
it O
also O
shows O
the O
sport O
of O
boxing O
at O
a O
crucial O
time O
of O
transition. O
In O
the O
late O
1800s O
boxing O
was O
moving O
away O
from O
the O
brutal B-TONE
days O
of O
bare-knuckle O
rules O
to O
the O
more O
"gentlemanly" O
days O
of O
the O
gloved, O
Marquis O
of O
Queensbury O
rules. O
And O
the O
sport O
was O
moving O
away O
from O
the O
days O
when O
it O
was O
an O
illegal O
spectacle O
and O
towards O
a O
time O
of O
acceptance O
and O
respectability.<br O
/><br O
/>"Gentleman O
Jim" O
is O
not O
a O
realistic O
look O
at O
those O
days. O
It O
is O
romanticized B-TONE
and, O
yes, O
even O
a O
bit O
hokey O
at O
times. O
But O
always O
delightfully O
so. O
Errol O
Flynn B-CAST
is O
perfect O
as O
the O
"Gentleman" O
Jim O
who O
really O
isn't O
a O
"gentleman" O
at O
all O
but O
merely O
a O
fast O
talker O
from O
a O
working O
class O
family. B-FRANCHISE
Alexis O

has O
a O
love/hate O

it O
is, O

the O

the O
best O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
in O
any O

Realistic? O
No. O

wonderful. O
Hey, O
if O
you O
want O
realism B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
watch O
"Raging O

instead. O
That O
is O
a O
much O
more O
realistic O
boxing O
movie. O
But O
"Gentleman O
Jim" O
is O
a O
lot O
more O
fun. B-PERFORMANCE

That O
this O
movie O
has O
been O
stapled O
to O
the O
wall O
of O
a O
chapel O
as O
proof O
that O
God O
is O
truly O
dead. O
Am O
I O
the O
only O
one O
that O
really O
saw O
(rather O
sleptwalked) O
through O
this O
"film"? O
This O
is O
the O
only O
movie O
I've O
ever O
seen O
in O
the O
theater O
that O
I O
regret O
not O
walking O
out O
on O
and O
demanding O
my O
money O
back O
-- O
it O
was O
just O
that O
dull. B-TONE
And O
I O
even O
saw O
"Highlander O
2: O
The O
Quickening" O
at O
the O
local O
cinema. O
From O
beginning O
to O
end, O
Gibson O
and O
Downey O
have O
absolutely O
no O
chemistry O
as O
two O
unlikelies, O
cast B-CAST
together O
by O
circumstance, O
who O
eventually O
work O
together O
as O
best O
buddies. O
The O
action B-GENRE
(what O
little O
there O
is) O
is O
goofy O
and O
as O
dull B-TONE
as O
the O
skullbone O
of O
the O
writer. O
Thank O
whatever O
deity O
is O
chortling O
down O
at O
us O
as O
it O
observes O
our O
"cinema" O
that O
there's O
no O
chance O
for O
an O
"Air O
America O
2." O

Well, O
there's O
no O
real O
plot B-CLICHES
to O
speak O
of, O
it's O
just O
an O
excuse O
to O
show O
some O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
of O
extreme O
violence B-GENRE
and O
gratuitous O
sex O
(which O
can O
sometimes O
be O
fun, B-PERFORMANCE
too, O
but O
it's O
not O
in O
this O
case). O
What O
else O
can O
I O
say O
about O
this...? O
The O
action, B-GENRE
when O
happening, O
is O
inventive O
and O
there's O
a O
cool B-MUSIC
scene O
where O
two O
characters B-CAST
are O
falling O
from O
a O
skyscraper O
(one O
that O
has O
to O
be O
several O
miles O
high), O
but O
overall O
there's O
not O
much O
to O
recommend O
"Kite". O
Watch O
it O
if O
you O
want, O
but O
you're O
not O
missing O
much O
if O
you O
skip O
this O
one... O

This O
is O
the O
best O
film O
the O
Derek O
couple O
has O
ever O
made O
and O
if O
you O
think O
this O
is O
a O
recommendation O
then O
you O
haven't O
seen O
any O
of O
the O
others. O
There O
are O
the O
usual O
ingredients: O
it O
is O
just O
as O
poorly O
acted O
as O
their O
other O
efforts, O
we O
can O
watch O
Bo O
disrobing O
or O
auditioning O
for O
wet O
T-shirt O
contests O
quite O
frequently, O
the O
story B-STORY
is O
just O
laughably O
idiotic, O
and O
the O
film O
takes O
itself O
much O
too O
seriously. O
And O
then: O
Orang O
Utans O
in O
Africa?<br O
/><br O
/>But O
it O
has O
a O
few O
things O
going O
for O
it. O
Bo O
looks O
great, O
the O
production O
values O
(sets, O
costumes, O
etc.) O
are O
quite O
good, B-CAST
and O
this O
greatly O
enhances O
its O
camp O
value. O
In O
a O
strange O
way O
it O
is O
actually O
quite O
funny, B-HUMOR
simply O
because O
it O
tries O
to O
be O
serious O
and O
fails O
so O
badly. O

Some O
people O
drift O
through O

moving O
from O
one O
thing O
or O
one O
person O
to O
the O
next O
without O
batting O

latch O

a O
principle O

remain O
adamant, O

is-- O

figuratively O
or O
literally O
they O
give O
their O

we're O
all O

what O
makes O

Some O

just O
plain O

maybe O
that's O

And O
when O

Carl O

she O
refuses O
to O
give O
up O

Maybe O
it's O

even O
more O
about O
herself.<br O
/><br O

There's O
a O
touch O
of O
humor, O
a O
touch O
of O
romance, B-STORY
and O
some O
insights O
into O
human O
nature O
in O
this O
quirky B-HUMOR
film O
that O
is O
more O
about O
characterization O
and O
character O
than O
plot. B-CLICHES
And O
Krueger B-DIRECTION
presents O
it O
all O
extremely O
well, O
delivering O
a O
film O
that O
is O
engaging O
and O
entertaining. O
Her O
characters B-CAST
are O
very O
real O
people, O
with O
all O
the O
wants, O
needs O
and O
imperfections O
that O
make O
up O
the O
human O
condition; O
a O
rich B-CLICHES
and O
eclectic O
bunch O
through O
which O
she O
tells O
her O
story. B-STORY
We O
see O
it O
from O
Joline's O
point-of-view, O
as O
Krueger B-DIRECTION
makes O
us O
privy O
to O
Joline's O
thoughts O
and O
therefore O
her O
motivations, O
which O
puts O
a O
decided O
perspective O
on O
the O
events O
as O
they O
unfold. O
That, O
along O
with O
the O
deliberate O
pace O
she O
sets O
that O
allows O
you O
to O
soak O
up O
the O
atmosphere O
and O
the O
ambiance O
she O
creates, O
makes O
for O
a O
very O
effective O
piece O
of O
storytelling. B-DIRECTION
There's O
an O
underlying O
seriousness O
to O
this O
subject O
matter, O
but O
Krueger B-DIRECTION
chooses O
to O
avoid O
anything O
heavy-handed O
or O
too O
deep O
and O
concentrates O
instead O
on O
the O
natural B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
humor O
that O
evolves O
from O
the O
people O
and O
situations O
that O
Joline O
encounters. O
And O
the O
result O
is O
a O
well O
textured, O
affecting O
and O
upbeat O
look O
at O
that O
thing O
we O
call O
life.<br O
/><br O

Heather O
Graham O
takes O
hold O
of O
this O
role O
from O
the O
first O
frame O
of O
the O
film O
to O
make O
Joline O
a O
character O
totally O
of O
her O
own O
creation. O
She O
immerses O
herself O
in O
the O
part O
and O
gives O
a O
performance B-CAST
that O
is O
convincing B-PERFORMANCE
and O
believable, B-PERFORMANCE
adding O
the O
little O
personal O
traits O
and O
nuance O
that O
makes O
all O
the O
difference O
between O
a O
portrayal O
that O
is O
a O
mere O
representation O
of O
a O
person, O
and O
one O
that O
is O
real. O
And O
for O
this O
film O
to O
work, O
it O
was O
imperative O
that O
Joline O
be O
viable O
and O
believable-- B-PERFORMANCE
and O
Graham O
succeeds O
on O
all O
fronts. O
Her O
screen O
presence O
has O
never O
been O
more O
alluring, O
and O
her O
vibrant B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
personality O
or O
even O
just O
the O
way O
she O
uses O
her O
eyes, O
is O
enough O
to O
draw O
you O
in O
entirely. O
it's O
all O
a O
part O
of O
the O
character O
she O
creates; O
there's O
an O
appeal O
to O
Joline O
that O
exudes O
from O
her O
entire O
countenance, O
who O
she O
is O
inside O
and O
out. O
She's O
a O
likable, O
agreeable O
person, O
and O
because O
you've O
shared O
her O
innermost O
thoughts, O
you O
know O
who O
she O
is. O
It's O
a O
good B-CAST
job O
all O
the O
way O
around, O
beginning O
with O
the O
way O
the O
character O
was O
written, O
to O
the O
way O
Graham O
brings O
her O
so O
vibrantly O
to O
life.<br O
/><br O
/> O
As O
Carmen, O
Patricia O
Velazquez O
is O
totally O
engaging, O
as O
well. O
Her O
performance B-CAST
is O
very O
natural B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
and O
straightforward, O
and O
she O
uses O
her O
instincts O
to O
effectively O
create O
her O
character. O
She O
has O
a O
charismatic B-PERFORMANCE
presence, O
but O
is O
less O
than O
flamboyant, O
and O
it O
gives O
her O
an O
aspect O
that O
is O
attractively O
down-to-earth. O
She O
is O
refreshingly O
open O
and O
up-front; O
you O
get O
the O
impression O
that O
Carmen O
is O
not O
one O
to O
hold O
anything O
back, O
but O
is O
totally O
honest O
on O
all O
fronts, O
and O
that, O
too, O
is O
part O
of O
her O
appeal. O
And, O
as O
with O
Joline, O
this O
character O
is O
well O
written, O
and O
Velazquez O
brings O
her O
convincingly O
to O
life.<br O

Overall, O
there O

a O
number O

notable O
performances O

A O
film O
that O
says O
something O
about O
the O
value O
of O
stepping O
back O
to O
consider O
The O
Big O

reflecting O

we O
are, O
where O
we're O
going O

what O
we O
really O
need-- O
`Committed' O

an O
enjoyable O

a O
ride O
definitely O
worth O
taking. O
8/10. O

Ho-hum. O
An O
inventor's(Horst O

biological O
weapon O
is O
in O
danger O
of O
falling O

Unknowingly O
his O
son(Luke O

Enter O
CIA O
agent O
Olivia O

the O
cat-and-mouse O
car O

Also O
in O
the O
cast B-CAST
are:Tom O
Conti, O
Hendrick O

an O
aging O
Roger O
Moore. O
Moore O
seems O
to O
haggardly O
move O
through O
this O
mess O
definitely O
not O
one O
of O
his O
better O
efforts. O
Perry O
fans O
will O
be O
accepting. O
d'Abo O
is O
wrong O
for O
the O
role, O
but O
nice O
to O
look O
at. O

Note O
to O
self. O
Never O
ever O
ever O
again O
watch O
a O
serious O
movie O
with O
Charlie O
Sheen B-CAST
in O
it. O
Great O
comedian, O
horrible O
seal. O
This O
movie O
makes O
Navy O
SEALS O
look O
like O
a O
reckless O
group O
of O
rangers O
when, O
in O
fact, O
they O
are O
the O
most O
elite O
form O
of O
military O
in O
the O
world. O
Charlie O
Sheen B-CAST
helps O
destroy O
the O
Navy O
SEAL O
reputation. O
Thank O
you O
for O
making O
such O
an O
incredibly O
select O
group O
of O
individuals O
look O
awful O
in O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
action B-GENRE
movies O
I O
have O
ever O
seen. O
This O
is O
a O
great O
story B-STORY
which O
could O
be O
made O
into O
an O
amazing O
action B-GENRE
movie, O
but O
why O
Charlie O
Sheen? B-CAST
There O
are O
possibilities O
for O
a O
very O
passionate O
story B-STORY
here, O
but O
Sheen B-CAST
decides O
to O
wreck O
them O
with O
"funny" B-HUMOR
comments. O

This O
movie O
is O
stupid. O
There's O
no O
getting O
around O
it. O
But O
so O
is O
Dumb O
and O
Dumber. O
Mind O
you, O
Dumb O
and O
Dumber O
is O
significantly O
more O
funny B-HUMOR
than O
this. O
However, O
I O
for O
one O
love O
seeing O
stupid O
movies O
(Tail O
Sting) O
and O
laughing O
with O
a O
group O
of O
good B-CAST
friends O
over O
how O
bad O
it O
is. O
Call O
me O
callous, O
but O
see O
this O
movie, O
and O
you'll O
find O
that O
the O
only O
way O
you O
can O
laugh O
at O
it O
is O
if O
you O
laugh O
at O
it O
instead O
of O
with O
it. O

I O
was O
looking O
forward O
to O
this O
so O
much, O
being O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
the O
book. O
However, O
when O
it O
came O
out O
I O
remember O
thinking O
it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
wastes O
of O
money O
and O
time O
I've O
ever O
spent O
at O
the O
cinema.<br O
/><br O
/>In O
principle, O
the O
acting, B-CAST
the O
sets O
and O
the O
music B-MUSIC
were O
excellent, O
and O
are O
the O
main O
reason O
why O
I'm O
rating O
this O
a O
4.<br O
/><br O
/>In O
this O
version, O
Sara O
is O
a O
little O
too O
self-sacrificing O
for O
my O
taste. O
There O
is O
no O
way O
she O
would O
have O
deliberately O
lied O
to O
Miss O
Minchin O
just O
to O
stop O
her O
punishing O
the O
other O
girls; O
in O
the O
book O
she O
makes O
a O
point O
of O
describing O
lies O
as O
"not O
just O
wicked, O
but O
vulgar." O
<br O
/><br O
/>There's O
also O
far O
too O
much O
of O
a O
Disneyfied O
ending O
for O
me; O
Sara's O
father O
coming O
back O
from O
the O
dead O
and O
all O
of O
them O
trotting O
off O
into O
the O
Indian O
sunset. O
While O
the O
book O
does O
have O
a O
happy O
(and O
critics O
might O
say O
equally O
improbable) O
ending, O
it O
doesn't O
leave O
you O

"Oh O
puh-leeze."<br O

the O
only O
things O
true O
to O

All O
I O
can O
say O

all O
you O
want O
is O
a O
'feel-good' O
family B-FRANCHISE

then O
this O
delivers. O
If O
you're O

if O
you've O
read O

don't O
waste O

with O
this O
one. O
It's O
such O
a O

with O
a O
cast B-CAST

this, O
if O
they'd O
stuck O

that O
a O
little O
too O

i O
really O

keep O

i O
would O
say O
more O
but O
it O
think O
it O
would O
spoil O
the O

this O

not O

deal O
with O

also O
about O

i O
do O
think O
that O
it O
is O

if O
your O
not O

Ken O
Burns' O
"Baseball" O
is O
a O
decent O
documentary... O
it O
presents O
a O
clear O
origin B-REMAKES
of O
the O
game, O
a O
great O
depiction O
of O
baseball's O
early O
years O
and O
heroes. O
There's O
plenty O
in O
this O
movie O
for O
any O
baseball O
fan... O
that O
said, O
the O
film O
has O
several O
glaring O
flaws.<br O
/><br O
/>18 O
hours O
is O
simply O
too O
long O
for O
the O
human O
attention O
span. O
It's O
clear O
that O
Burns O
stretched O
his O
film O
out O
to O
fit O
his O
"nine O
inning" O
concept. O
It's O
not O
even O
a O
tight O
18 O
hours... O
the O
pace O
on O
every O
segment O
is O
slow, B-TONE
almost O
morose... O
the O
music B-MUSIC
always O
nostalgic B-TONE
and O
wistful. O
Isn't O
baseball O
ever O
exciting O
and O
fun? B-PERFORMANCE
Why O
is O
every O
player O
and O
their O
accomplishments O
presented O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
tragedy? O
Talking O
head O
after O
talking O
head O
turn O
every O
pitch O
into O
an O
emotional O
heartbreak, O
yakking O
about O
baseball O
as O
a O
metaphor, O
baseball O
as O
Americana, O
the O
psychology O
and O
theology O
of O
baseball... O
enough! O
This O
is O
syrupy, O
mawkish O
drivel. O
Billy O
Crystal O
is O
here O
to O
sell O
us O
all O
the O
Yankee O
hokum O
he's O
sold O
us O
before. O
Ken O
Burns O
uses O
the O
National O
Anthem O
as O
the O
series' B-FRANCHISE
theme B-MUSIC
song, O
and O
manages O
to O
play O
"Take O
Me O
Out O
To O
The O
Ballgame" O
so O
many O
times O
you O
might O
vomit. O
We O
get O
it, O
dude.<br O
/><br O
/>Clearly O
Burns O
is O
a O
neo-Hollywood O
faux-liberal, O
so O
he O
spends O
probably O
a O
third O
of O
the O
film O
on O
the O
Negro O
leagues... O
these O
segments O
are O
spent O
chastising O
whites O
of O
yesterday O
for O
not O
being O
as O
open-minded O
as O
Kenny O
is O
today. O
For O
shame! O
He O
chides O
baseball O
for O
being O
segregated O
in O
the O
thirties O
and O
forties O
but O
fails O
to O
realize O
that O
America O
was O
segregated O
in O
those O
times! O
Burns O
falls O
head O
over O
heels O
in O
love O
with O
Buck O
O'Neil, O
a O
former O
negro-league O
player, O
and O
drools O
over O
every O
piece O
of O
footage O
in O
which O
the O
elderly O
O'Neil O
waxes O
poetic O
about O
his O
playing O
days. O
Nonsense...<br O
/><br O
/>Burns O
would O
have O
been O
better O
off O
with O
an O
adult O
to O
help O
him O
edit O
his O
creation O
down. O
"Baseball" O
winds O
up O
as O
mushy, O
gushy, O
civil-rights O
propaganda B-STORY
disguised O
as O
Americana. O
Its O
clear O
that O
Burns O
is O
not O
a O
baseball O
fan... O
otherwise O
he O
would O
know O
we O
watch O
games O
laughing O
and O
cheering, O
not O
weeping O
and O
reciting O
soliloquies... O
are O
you O
listening, O
Mr. O
Burns? O
There's O
no O
crying O
in O
baseball. O

"Quitting" O
may O
be O
as O
much O
about O
exiting O
a O
pre-ordained O
identity B-STORY

about O

As O
a O
rural O

Troubles O
arise, O
however, O
when O
the O

<br O
/><br O
/>Hongshen O
Jia O
is O
in O
his O
mid-twenties. O
He's O
a O
talented O
actor, B-CAST
impressionable, O
vain, O
idealistic, O
and O
perhaps O
emotionally O
starved. O
The O
perfect O
recipe O
for O
his O
enablers. O
Soon O
he's O
the O
"cool" B-MUSIC
actor, B-CAST
idolized O
by O
youth. O
"He O
was O
hot O
in O
the O
early O
nineties." O
"He O
always O
had O
to O
be O
the O
most O
fashionable." O
He O
needs O
extremes, O
and O
goes O
in O
for O
heavy O
metal, O
adopts O
earrings O
and O
a O
scarf. O
His O
acting B-CAST
means O
the O
arts, O
friends--and O
roles, O
But O
not O
the O
kind O
that O
offer O
any O
personal O
challenge O
or O
input. O
And O
his O
self-criticism, O
dulled O
by O
the O
immediacy O
of O
success, O
opens O
the O
doors O
to O
an O
irrational O
self-doubt, O
self-hatred-- O
"I O
didn't O
know O
how O
to O
act" O
"I O
felt O
like O
a O
phony"--and O
to O
readily O
available O
drugs O
to O
counter O
them. O
He O
says O
"I O
had O
to O
get O
high O
to O
do O
what O
director B-DIRECTION
wanted." O
So, O
his O
shallow O
identity B-STORY
as O
an O
actor B-CAST
becomes, O
via O
drugs, O
an O
escape B-STORY
from O
identity. B-STORY
<br O
/><br O
/>Hongshen's O
disengagement O
from O
drugs O
and O
his O
false O
life O
is O
very O
gradual, O
intermittent--and O
doggedly O
his O
own. O
Solitude, O
space, O
meditative O
thinking, O
speech O
refusal, O
replace O
therapy. O
The O
abstract O
is O
out. O
And O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
his O
change O
occurs O
outdoors---not O
in O
idealized O
locations O
but O
mainly O
on O
green O
patches O
under O
the O
freeways, O
bridges, O
and O
high-rises O
of O
Beijing. O
The O
physicality O
is O
almost O
romantic, B-FRANCHISE
but O
is O
not. O
The O
bike O
rides O
to O
Ritan O

the O
long O
spontaneous O
walks, O
the O
drenching O

the O
sky O
patterns O
and O
kites O
that O
absorb O
his O
musing O
are O
very O
specific. O
He O
drifts O
in O

to O
arrive, O
all O
the O
while O
picking O
up O
cues O
to O
a O
more O
real O
and O
realistic O

"I O
started O
to O
open O
up" O
he O
says O
of O
this O
period B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
in O
retrospect. O
And O
the O
contact O
seems O
to O
start O
with O
his O
lanky O
body O
which O
projects O
a O
kind O
of O
dancer's O
positioning O
(clumsy, O
graceful, O
humorous, O
telling) O
in O
a O
current O
circumstance. O
If O
mind O
or O
spirit O
is O
lacking, O
his O
legs O
can O
compel O
him O
to O
walk O
all O
night. B-STORY
<br O
/><br O

to O
his O

To O
punctuate O

down O

iconic O
anti-establishment O

he's O

even O

"Mother O

"Music B-MUSIC

says. O
And O
speaks O
of O

In O
the O
mental O

the O
life-saving O
apples O
(resistance, O

reflect O

Fegsen's O
differences O
from O
his O
son O
that O
underwrites O
his O
change. O
For O
the O
father O
is O
more O
secure O
in O
himself: O
he O
accepts O
that O
he's O
Chinese, O
a O
peasant O
in O
a O
line O
of O
peasants, O
a O
rural O
theater O
director. B-DIRECTION
And O
he O
exercises O
control O
over O
both O
his O
habit O
and O
his O
emotions. O
It's O
this O
recognizable O
identity B-STORY
that O
drives O
Hongshen O
to O
treat O
him O
like O
a O
sounding O
board, O
sometimes O
with O
anger O
and O
rage, O
sometimes O
with O
humor O
(the O
blue O
jeans, O
Beatles) O
and O
passivity. O
In O
his O
most O
crazed, O
and O
violent O
exchange O
with O
his O
father O
in O
which O
he O
accuses O
him O
of O
being O
a O
liar, O
and O
a O
fake, O
he O
exposes O
more O
of O
himself O
than O
his O
father: O
"all O
the O
acts O
I O
acted O
before O
were O
bullshit... O
life O
is O
bullshit." O
And O
to O
Hongshen's O
emphatic O
"you O
are O
NOT O
my O
father," O
he O
softly O
replies, O
"why O
can't O
a O
peasant O
be O
your O
father?" O
<br O

these O

from O
his O
mother, O
sister, O

at O

he O
makes O
some O
tangible O
connection O
to O
a O
real O
(not O
whole) O
self. O
As O
the O
long O
term O
drug O
effects O
recede, O
so O
does O
his O
old O
identity. B-STORY
Indebtedness O
replaces O
pride, O
trust O
distrust. O
Integrity O
banishes O
his O
black B-HUMOR
cloud. O
All O
his O
edges O
soften. O
"You O
are O
just O
a O
human O

he O
repeats O
endlessly O
after O
being O
released O
from O
the O
strap-down O
incurred O
for O
refusing O
medicine. O
Back O
home, O

in O

Hongshen O
says O
of O
this O

"it's O
a O
good B-CAST
chance O
to O
think O

a O
major O
American O
movie O
studio O
(RKO O
Radio O
Pictures).<br O
/><br O
/>Joseph O
H. O
August's O
cinematography B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
is O
at O
its O
very O
best O
here. O
However, O
August's O
stunning O
portion O
was O
mostly O
overlooked; O
he O
didn't O
receive O
the O
Oscar B-PERFORMANCE
nomination O
he O
rightly O
deserved.<br O
/><br O
/>This O
is O
a O
psychological B-GENRE
drama, B-GENRE
with O
thought, O
philosophy, O
sadness, O
all O
conveyed O
with O
as O
little O
words O
as O
possible. O

How O
do O
you O
take O
a O
cast B-CAST
of O
experienced, O
well-known O
actors, O
and O
put O
together O
such O
a O
stupid O
movie? O
Nimrod O
Antel O
has O
the O
answer: O
Armored. O
Six O
co-workers O
at O
an O
armored O
car O
business O
decide O
to O
steal O
a O
large O
shipment O
of O
cash O
themselves. O
But, O
just O
as O
they O
get O
to O
first O
base O
with O
their O
plans, O
everything O
unravels O
quickly. O
With O
a O
plot B-CLICHES
like O
this, O
you'd O
think O
it O
couldn't O
be O
too O
bad, O
at O
least O
for O
an O
action B-GENRE
movie. O
However, O
in O
the O
first O
40 O
minutes O
or O
more O
of O
this O
movie O
we O
see O
what O
appear O
to O
be O
6 O
normal, O
everyday O
kind O
of O
guys. O
They O
joke, O
they O
laugh, O
have O
a O
few O
drinks O
together, O
etc. O
Then, O
we O
suddenly O
learn O
they're O
planning O
to O
rob O
their O
own O
business. O
The O
hero B-CLICHES
Ty, O
(Columbus O
Short), B-CAST
is O
sucked O
into O
the O
scheme O
because O
of O
the O
cold, O
cruel O
world, O
even O
though O
he's O
a O
decorated O
veteran, O
nice O
guy, O
and O
reliable O
employee. O
Oh O
my, O
oh O
my! O
Then O
in O
the O
last O
40 O
minutes O
of O
the O
film, O
these O
former O
regular O
guys O
nearly O
all O
turn O
into O
money-crazed O
psychos, O
willing O
to O
butcher O
each O
other O
for O
cash. O
In O
the O
last O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
Mike, O
(Matt O
Dillon), B-CAST
goes O
on O
a O
suicidal O
rampage O
for O
no O
other O
reason O
than O
to O
kill O
his O
former O
friend. O
The O
viewer O
has O
no O
hint O
before O
this O
ending O
that O
these O
men O
are O
this O
ruthless O
and O
bloodthirsty. O
It's O
utterly O
unbelievable O
and O
"B O
movie" O
is O
almost O
too O
kind O
for O
this O
sort O
of O
cheesy B-HUMOR
plot. B-CLICHES
I O
would O
say O
don't O
waste O
your O
time--too O
bad O
no O
one O
gave O
Laurence O
Fishburne, O
Jean O
Reno O
or O
Fred O
Ward O
the O
same O
advice O
before O
making O
this O
picture. O

The O
sexploitation B-GENRE
movie O
era O
of O
the O
late O
sixties O
and O
early O
seventies O
began O
with O
the O
allowance O
of O
gratuitous O
nudity O
in O
mainstream O
films O
and O
ended O
with O
the O
legalization O
of O
hardcore B-GENRE
porn. O
It's O
peak O
years O
were O
between O
1968 O
and O
1972. O
One O
of O
the O
most O
loved O
and O
talented O
actresses O
of O
the O
era O
was O
Monica O
Gayle, O
who O
had O
a O
small O
but O
fanatic O
cult B-FRANCHISE
of O
followers. O
She O
was O
actually O
able O
to O
act, O
unlike O
many O
who O
filled O
the O
lead O
roles O
of O
these O
flicks, O
and O
her O
subsequent O
credits O
proved O
it. O
And O
her O
seemingly O
deliberate O
fade O
into O
obscurity O
right O
when O
her O
career O
was O
taking O
off O
only O
heightens O
her O
mystique.<br O
/><br O
/>Gary O
Graver, B-DIRECTION
the O
director, B-DIRECTION
was O
also O
a O
talent; O
probably O
too O
talented O
for O
the O
sexploitation B-GENRE
genre, O
and O
his O
skill, O
combined O
with O
Monica O
Gayle's O
screen O
presence, O
makes O
Sandra, O
the O
Making O
of O
a O
Woman, O
a O
pleasantly O
enjoyable O
experience. O
The O
film O
never O
drags O
and O
you O
won't O
have O
your O
finger O
pressed O
on O
the O
fast-forward O
button. O

What O
a O
surprisingly O
good B-CAST
movie O
this O
one O
turned O
out O
to O
be. O
This O
is O
the O
type O
of O
film O
that O
I've O
been O
looking O
for O
ages. O
Particularly O
important O
for O
me O
was O
the O
fantastic-looking O
Chicago, O
which O
I O
still O
keep O
thinking O
about. O
The O
back O
cover O
doesn't O
do O
this O
film O
justice, O
it's O
superb, O
and O
in O
my O
top-5 O
for O
sure. O

I O
did O
not O
expect O
much O
from O
this O
film, O
but O
boy-o-boy, O
I O
did O
not O
expect O
the O
movie O
to O
be O
this O
bad. O
Chris O
Rock O
is O
not O
showing O
a O
good B-CAST
act O
here, O
you O
can't O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
his O
caracter O
is O
real, O
I O
think O
the O
movie O
would O
have O
been O
a O
bit O
better O
if O
it's O
drama B-GENRE
or O
romantic B-FRANCHISE
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
would O
have O
been O
a O
less O
part O
of O
the O
movie O
and O
more/better O
humor O
was O
involved. O
The O
movie O
is O
like O
the O
film O
makers O
were O
having O
a O
bad O
hangover O
making O
it. O
In O
the O
"making O
of" O
they O
don't O
show O
a O
single O
smile. O
This O
is O
a O
very O
bad O
film! O
I O
gave O
it O
three O
out O
of O
ten O
because O
of O
few O
smiles O
it O
gave O
me, O
but O
I O
did O
never O
laugh! O

I O
cant O
believe O
there O
are O
people O
out O
there O
that O
did O
not O
like O
this O
movie! O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
the O
funniest O
movie O
i O
had O
ever O
seen. O
It O
my O
have O
been O
b/c O
i O
am O
Mel O
Brooks O
biggest O
fan... O
I O
know O
almost O
all O
the O
words O
and O
get O
very O
discouraged O
when O
they O
censor O
them, O
when O
it O
is O
played O
on O
a O
Family B-FRANCHISE
Channel. O
:) O
this O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
movies, O
so O
i O
dont O
know O
why O
any O
one O
would O
disagree! O

Flynn, B-CAST
known O
mostly O
for O
his O
swashbuckling O
roles O
(and O
his O
bedroom O
antics!) O
takes O
a O
different O
tack O
with O
this O
film O
and O
it O
works O
beautifully. O
Playing O
real-life O
boxing O
champ O
Jim O
Corbett, O
Flynn B-CAST
turns O
on O
the O
charm O
full O

as O
he O
makes O
his O
way O
from O
a O
stifled O
San O
Francisco O
bank O
teller O
to O
a O
celebrated O
pugilist, O
all O
the O
while O
setting O
one O
eye O
on O
society O
deb O

He O
and O
best O
pal O
Carson O
attend O
an O
illegal O
bare-knuckle O
fight B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS

(and O

including O
a O
prominent O

The O
next O

he O
gets O
a O
chance, O
via O
Smith, O
to O
gain O
entrance O
to O
the O
judge's O
private O

He O
uses O
this O
opportunity O
to O
weasel O
his O
way O
into O
the O
good B-CAST
graces O
of O
its O
exclusive O
members O
and O
land O

His O
unusually O
adept O
skill O

soon O

champion B-STORY
John O
L. O
Sullivan O
(Bond.) O
Flynn B-CAST
is O
downright O
magical O
here. O
He O
is O
the O
epitome O
of O
charm, O
charisma O
and O
appeal O
in O
this O
role. O
He O
looks O
terrific B-PERFORMANCE
(especially O
in O
a O
hangover O
scene O
with O
his O
hair O
mussed O
and O
wearing O
a O
white O
union O
suit) O
and O
does O
virtually O
all O
of O
his O
own O
stuntwork O
(impressively!) O
His O
line O
delivery O
is O
delicious O
and O
he O
is O
credible O
and O
sympathetic O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
duplicitous O
and O
rascally. O
Smith O
exudes O
class O
and O
taste O
from O
every O
pore O
and O
is O
a O
good B-CAST
match O
for O
Flynn. B-CAST
At O
this O
stage, O
he O
needed O
a O
female O
costar O
who O
could O
stand O
up O
to O
his O
advances O
and O
reputation O
(he O
was O
undergoing O
statutory O
rape O
charges O
at O
the O
time) O
and O
she O
does O
so O
admirably. O
She O
is O
repulsed O
by O
his O
freshness O
and O
cavalier O
attitude, O
yet O
can O
hardly O
help O
but O
fall O
under O
his O
enchanting O
spell. O
Bond O
is O
incredibly O
burly, O
brawny O
and O
towering, O
yet O
tender O
when O
the O
script B-STORY
calls O
for O
it. O
Amusing O
support O
is O
provided O
by O
a O
young O
and O
ebullient O
Carson. O
Frawley O
is O
his O
dependably O
cantankerous O
self O
as O
Flynn's O
manager. O
The O
rest O
of O
the O
cast B-CAST
is O
excellent O
as O
well O
including O
Flynn's O
rambunctious O
family B-FRANCHISE
and O
an O
assortment O
of O
stuffy O
Nob O
Hill O
types. O
The O
whole O
thing O
is O
beautifully O
appointed O
and O
securely O
directed. O
A O
few O
of O
the O
sets O
are O
amazingly O
presented. O
Some O
of O
Smith's O
gowns O
border O
on O
the O
garish, O
but O
she O
suits O
the O
upswept O
hairstyles O
very O
well. O
It's O
a O
terrific B-PERFORMANCE
glimpse O
into O
the O
earliest O
days O
of O
championship O
boxing, O
but O
it's O
also O
so O
much O
more. O
Some O
of O
it O
(like O
the O
character O
traits O
shown O
by O
Flynn) B-CAST
is O
enhanced O
or O
exaggerated O
for O
entertainment O
purposes, O
but O
a O
lot O
of O
it O
is O
authentic B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
(like O
the O

and O

shown O
in O
the O

One O
line O
is O
particularly O
memorable: B-MUSIC
"I O
believe O
you O
like O

more O

It's O
classic B-GENRE
romantic B-FRANCHISE

there O
are O
more O
than O
a O
few O

every O

you O
would O
want O
in O
a O

like O
great O

a O
Outrageous O

you O
are O
missing O
out O

one O

the O
greatest O

made. O
i O
can't O
wait O
till O
her O
new O
movie O
comes O
out! O

I O
saw O
this O
movie O
on O
the O
Hallmark O
Channel O
and O
thought O
it O
was O
wonderful, O
especially O
since O
it O
was O
based O
on O
a O
true O
man. O
Pierce O
Brosnan B-CAST
was O
very O
good B-CAST
as O
the O
loner O
English O
man O
who O
took O
on O
the O
persona O
of O
the O
half O
breed O
Grey O
Owl. O
The O
photography O
was O
beautiful.<br O
/><br O
/>This O
movie O
made O
me O
do O
more O
research O
into O
this O
character O
Archie O
Belaney O
known O
simple O
as O
Grey O
Owl. O
I O
want O
to O
read O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can O
about O
him. O
At O
the O
time O
I O
did O
not O
know O
Richard O
Attenborough B-DIRECTION
had O
directed O
it. O
But O
I O
am O
not O
surprised. O
I O
like O
all O
his O
movies O
whether O
he O
is O
acting B-CAST
or O
directing. B-DIRECTION
I O
gave O
it O
the O
highest O
rating. O
However, O
I O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
have O
seen O
more O
in O
the O
movie O
about O
WHY O
he O
took O
on O
this O
persona O
as O
it O
only O
showed O
the O
two O
aunts O
who O
raised O
him O
and O
his O
room O
in O
their O
house.<br O
/><br O
/>You O
can't O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
movie O
if O
you O
are O
like O
me O
and O
enjoy O
a O
beautiful O
story B-STORY
without O
hearing O
foul O
language O
and O
contrived O
special B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
effects O
every O
few O
minutes. O

Despite O
having O
an O
absolutely O
horrid O
script B-STORY
(more O
about O
that O
later), O
this O
film O
is O
still O
vaguely O
watchable O
just O
because O
it O
stars O
two O
excellent O
actors, O
Barbara O
Stanwyck B-CAST
and O
Henry O
Fonda. O
Aside O
from O
one O
or O
two O
REAL O
stinkers, O
I'd O
probably O
watch O
just O
about O
anything O
with O
them O
in O
the O
film, O
as O
I O
am O
a O
huge O
fan O
of O
Hollywood's O
golden O
age O
of O
the O
1930s O
and O
40s. O
However, O
no O
matter O
how O
much O
I O
love O
their O
films, O
I O
just O
can't O
recommend O
this O
film.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
movie O
begins O
with O
Fonda O
and O
Stanwyck B-CAST
on O
vacation O
at O
some O
ski O
resort. O
The O
two O
haven't O
yet O
met, O
but O
the O
film O
begins O
loudly O
and O
obnoxiously O
with O
a O
scene O
in O
which O
Fonda O
horribly O
yodels O
while O
skiing. O
It O
was O
done O
so O
unsubtly O
and O
made O
my O
teeth O
grind O
but O
I O
stuck O
it O
out--especially O
when O
Fonda O
fell O
into O
a O
snow O
bank O
and O
this O
stopped O
the O
yodeling!! O
In O
hindsight, O
perhaps O
I O
should O
have O
just O
turned O
it O
off O
then! O
Fonda O
is O
knocked O
out O
in O
the O
fall O
and O
Barbara O
goes O
for O
help. O
Back O
at O
the O
ski O
lodge, O
he O
seems O
okay O
but O
fortunately O
she O
is O
ALSO O
a O
doctor O
and O
has O
him O
x-rayed O
and O
nurses O
him O
back O
to O
health. O
He, O
in O
turn, O
becomes O
infatuated O
with O
her O
and O
proposes O
to O
her. O
Despite O
hardly O
knowing O
each O
other, O
they O
marry O
and O
so O
far O
the O
film O
seems O
like O
a O
sweet O
but O
very O
slight O
romantic B-FRANCHISE
comedy.<br O
/><br O
/>Once O
home, O
however, O
all O
isn't O
rosy O
as O
she O
jumps O
right O
back O
into O
her O
job O
as O
a O
family B-FRANCHISE
doctor O
and O
he O
begins O
exhibiting O
signs O
that O
he O
is O
a O
controlling O
and O
potentially O
dangerous O
man O
due O
to O
his O
jealousy. B-STORY
The O
film O
plays O
it O
all O
for O
laughs, O
but O
frankly O
Fonda's O
behaviors O
were O
really O
creepy--spying O
on O
her O
and O
her O
male O
patients, O
attacking O
or O
threatening O
ANY O
man O
she O
treats, O
tripping O
a O
patient O
who O
already O
has O
a O
back O
injury O
and O
stomping O
into O
a O
surprise O
party O
and O
insisting O
that O
everyone O
there O
(men O
and O
women) O
are O
out O
to O
steal O
away O
his O
wife. O
He O
comes O
off O
as O
a O
combination O
of O
a O
sociopath O
and O
paranoid O
schizophrenic, O
but O
it's O
all O
supposed O
to O
be O
for O
laughs. O
Considering O
that O
he O
seems O
like O
a O
dangerous O
nut, O
you O
would O
think O
that O
Stanwyck B-CAST
would O
file O
for O
an O
annulment O
along O
with O
a O
restraining O
order! O
But, O
oddly, O
she O
gets O
mad O
but O
just O
can't O
stay O
mad O
at O
Fonda O
because O
he's O
so........? O
I O
can't O
think O
of O
the O
right O
word--'creepy' O
is O
all O
that O
comes O
to O
mind!!! O
Later, O
out O
of O
the O
blue, O
multi-millionaire O
Fonda O
gets O
a O
job O
working O
the O
counter O
at O
a O
department O
store. O
Then, O
through O
magical O
thinking, O
he O
and O
Babs O
seem O
to O
assume O
his O
hostility O
and O
violent O
jealousy B-STORY
is O
all O
a O
thing O
of O
the O
past--so O
a O
job O
apparently O
cures O
anger O
and O
suspicions. O
When O
this O
job O
falls O
through, O
the O
film O
ends O
with O
Fonda O
buying O
his O
own O
hospital, O
giving O
Barbara O
a O
job O
there O
and O
they O
live O
happily O
ever O
after. O
They O
don't O
go O
any O
further O
with O
the O
story, B-STORY
but O
I O
assume O
based O
on O
Fonda's O
character O
that O
he O
then O
spent O
most O
of O
his O
time O
as O
hospital O
administrator O
beating O
up O
all O
the O
male O
patients.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
first O
portion O
at O
the O
ski O
lodge O
and O
the O
next O
did O
NOT O
fit O
well O
together, O
nor O
did O
the O
final O
"Horatio O
Alger" O
inspired O
section O
where O
the O
rich B-CLICHES
boy O
made O
good B-CAST
in O
the O
business O
world. O
They O
were O
like O
three O
separate O
plots O
but O
despite O
this, O
the O
most O
serious O
problem O
with O
the O
film O
was O
its O
seeming O
to O
excuse O
away O
domestic O
violence B-GENRE
and O
delusional O
jealousy! B-STORY
What O
a O
creepy O
little O
film! O
Thank O
goodness O
neither O
Fonda O
nor O
Stanwyck B-CAST
are O
known O
for O
this O
yechy O
film O
but O
for O
all O
their O
other O
lovely O
films. O

I O
find O
the O
critique O
of O
many O
IMDb O
users O
a O
little O
harsh O
and O
in O
many O
cases O
find O
that O
they O
crit O
the O
movie O
from O
a O
very O
professional O
viewpoint O
and O
not O
that O
of O
the O
guy O
on O
the O
street O
that O
wants O
to O
sit O
and O
watch O
something O
just O
to O
GET O
AWAY O
from O
it O
all.<br O
/><br O
/>In O
this O
case O
however O
I O
have O
to O
say O
it O
was O
BAD. O
I O
am O
a O
SciFi B-GENRE
junkie O
and O
there O
was O
NOTHING O
in O
this O
movie O
that O
grabbed O
me O
for O
even O
one O
second.<br O
/><br O
/>There O
was O
no O
proper O
storyline. O
I O
may O
be O
an O
idiot O
but O
I O
still O
do O
not O
know O
where O
the O
GOVERNMENT O
was O
that O
was O
so O
worried O
about O
these O
pieces.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
pathetic O
attempt O
by O
the O
main O
character O
to O
put O
together O
these O
3 O
pieces O
is O
scary. O
Half O
the O
time O
the O
two O
pieces O
were O
already O
in O
place O
and O
he O
simply O
had O
to O
add O
the O
third. O
A O
3 O
year O
old O
kid O
would O
have O
been O
able O
to O
put O
them O
together.<br O
/><br O
/>This O
movie O
was O
BAD.<br O
/><br O
/>Dominic O

I O
was O
debating O
between O
this O
movie O
and O
2012 O
but O
chose O
Inglourious O
Basterds O
due O
to O
it's O
amazingly O
high O
IMDb O
rating. O
I O
must O
say O
now, O
what O
a O
disappointment. O
I O
expected O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
gratuitous O
violence, B-GENRE
but O
I O
also O
expected O
a O
lot O
of O
witty O
dialog. O
I O
got O
a O
huge O
dosage O
of O
the O
former, O
but O
not O
nearly O
enough O
of O
the O
latter. O
I O
felt O
shortchanged. O
The O
ratio O
between O
violence B-GENRE
to O
plot B-CLICHES
is O
very O
important O
and O
I O
think O
this O
movie O
gets O
it O
totally O
wrong. O
And O
the O
plot? B-CLICHES
It's O
that O
believable B-PERFORMANCE
or O
really O
all O
that O
entertaining O
either. O
Save O
your O
time O
and O
money. O
I O
can't O
believe O
what O
this O
rating O
says O
for O
the O
gory O
and O
violent O
tastes O
of O
the O
modern O
masses. O

Bend O
it O
like O
Beckham O
is O
packed O
with O
intriguing O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
yet O
has O
an O
overall O
predictable B-CLICHES
stroy O
line. O
It O
is O
about O
a O
girl O
called O
Jess O
who O
is O
trying O
to O
achieve O
her O
life O
long O
dream O
to O
become O
a O
famous O
soccer O

and O
finally O
gets O
the O
chance O
when O
offered O
a O
position O
on O
a O
local O
team. O
there O
are O
so O
many O
boundaries O
and O
limits O
that O
she O
faces O
which O
hold O
her O
back O
yet O
she O
is O
still O
determined O

strives. O
i O
would O
recommend O
it O
for O
anyone O
who O
likes O
a O
nice O

The O
director B-DIRECTION
and O
co-writer O
says O
he O
wanted O
to O
mix O
genres O
- O
in O
this O
case O
drama B-GENRE
and O
comedy. B-GENRE
Well, O
at O
least O
here, O
these O
two O
mix O
like O
vinegar O
and O
oil. O
To O
boot, O
the O
comedy B-GENRE
is O
not O
very O
funny B-HUMOR
and O
juvenile. O
Additionally, O
the O
film O
is O
not O
really O
realistic. O
Liberties O
are O
taken O
regarding O
the O
legal O
system O
in O
committing O
French O
Citizens O
against O
their O
will O
and O
the O
apparent O
ease O
of O
absconding O
with O
drugs O
in O
French O
Hospitals. O
I O
watched O
this O
film O
on O
my O
big O
screen O
TV O
at O
home O
and O
found O
myself O
shouting O
at O
the O
film O
to O
move O
on. O
Eventually O
toward O
the O
end O
I O
fast O
forwarded O
the O
final O
long O
speech O
one O
of O
the O
main O
characters B-CAST
makes O
to O
his O
ex-lover's O
son. O
By O
that O
time O
I O
was O
worn O
out O
by O
the O
preposterous O
confused O
plot B-CLICHES
that O
deals O
with O
a O
dead O
lover, O
marriage O
of O
convenience O
and O
a O
nutty O
ex-lover. O
At O
times O
the O
plot B-CLICHES
diverts O
to O
the O
families O
of O
the O
two O
main O
characters B-CAST
and O
then O
reverts O
back O
to O
one O
of O
them O
- O
either O
Ismael O
or O
primarily O
Nora. O
To O
the O
detriment O
of O
the O
audience, O
viewpoints O
keep O
changing O
from O
Nora O
and O
Ismael, O
her O
ex-lover O
confined O
against O
his O
will O
in O
a O
psychiatric O
hospital. O
There O
probably O
are O
two O
potentially O
interesting O
films O
here O
neither O
of O
which O
are O
well O
developed. O
The O
epilogue O
does O
not O
really O
wrap O
up O
many O
of O
the O
sub-plots O
and O
seems O
to O
want O
the O
viewer O
to O
believe O
Nora O
somehow O
will O
find O
happiness O
although O
given O
her O
circumstances O
in O
real O
life O
the O
chances O
are O
equivalent O
to O
a O
snow O
ball's O
chance O
in O
hell. O
The O
actors O
do O
their O
best O
and O
are O
appealing, O
but O
this O
is O
not O
enough O
to O
overcome O
all O
the O
glaring O
faults O
of O
poor O
writing, B-STORY
editing B-DIRECTION
and O
lack O
of O

Incomprehensibly O
dreadful O

consider O
it O

intially O
discounted O

The O
movie O
itself, O
unfortunately, O
was O
quite O
a O
letdown. O
A O
number O
of O
parts O
of O
the O
story B-STORY
seemed O
inconsistent, O
of O
which O
I'll O
mention O
two. O
First O
was O
the O
idea O
that O
the O
police O
wouldn't O
enter O
the O
Casbah. O
That O
was O
stated O
pretty O
clearly O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
film O
by O
the O
local O
commander, O
and O
yet O
repeated O
references O
in O
the O
movie O
suggest O
that O
in O
fact O
the O
police O
did O
enter O
the O
Casbah O
fairly O
regularly. O
So, O
neither O
the O
suggestion O
by O
Commissioner O
Janvier O
that O
the O
police O
wouldn't O
enter, O
nor O
the O
statement O
by O
Inspector O
Slimane O
(also O
a O
decent O
performance B-CAST
by O
Joseph O
Calleia) O
that O
they O
could O
get O
into O
the O
Casbah O
but O
not O
out O
seemed O
to O
make O
much O
sense. O
I O
also O
found O
it O
difficult O
to O
believe O
that O
le O
Moko O
- O
hardened O
criminal O
mastermind O
that O
he O
was O
- O
could O
be O
so O
quickly O
swept O
off O
his O
feet O
by O
Gaby O
(Hedy O
Lamarr) O
to O
the O
point O
where O
he O
entertains O
the O
local O
populace O
by O
singing O
love O
songs B-MUSIC
and O
then O
leaves O
the O
Casbah O
to O
find O
her, O
essentially O
giving O
himself O
up. O
I O
understand O
the O
irony O
of O
the O
final O
few O
scenes, B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
of O
course, O
as O
Pepe O
leaves O
the O
freedom O
of O
his O
prison B-GENRE
(the O
Casbah) O
only O
to O
find O
real O
freedom O
in O
his O
capture O
(because O
he's O
shot O
and O
killed O
by O
the O
police.) O
I O
just O
found O
it O
impossible O
to O
believe O
that O
someone O
like O
le O
Moko O
would O
fall O
into O
such O
a O
trap.<br O
/><br O
/>This O
is O
worth O
watching O
for O
Boyer, B-CAST
and O
to O
a O
lesser O
extent O
Calleia, O
but O
the O
story B-STORY
is O
disappointing O
and O
inconsistent. O
3/10 O

Man O
with O
the O
Screaming O
Brain O
certainly O
isn't O
a O
perfect O
movie, O
but O
I'm O
pretty O
sure O
it O
was O
never O
meant O
to O
be O
anything O
more O
than O
a O
star O
vehicle O
for O
Bruce O
Campbell, B-CAST
meaning O
it O
works O
as O
kind O
of O
a O
summary O
of O
his O
entire O
career: O
slapstick, B-HUMOR
sarcasm, O
cheese, O
action, B-GENRE
and O
happy O
endings. O
Campbell B-CAST
is, O
as O
a O
writer, O
uneven--there O
are O
lots O
of O
things O
in O
the O
story B-STORY
that O
don't O
make O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
sense O
(why O
does O
the O
robot O
suddenly O
have O
breasts O
merely O
because O
a O
female O
brain O
has O
been O
implanted O
into O
it?), O
and O
some O
of O
the O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
feel O
like O
retreads O
of O
other, O
better O
incarnations O
(the O
scene O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
where O
Yegor O
and O
William O
battle O
for O
control O
of O
William's O
body, O
is O
straight O
out O
of O
Evil O
Dead O
II). O
There O
are, O
however, O
lots O
of O
little O
touches O
and O
non-sequiturs O
that O
feel O
rather O
brilliant, O
such O
as O
when O
William O
is O
in O
the O
height O
of O
his O
panic O
and O
screams O
at O
a O
statue, O
"What O
are O
you O
looking O
at?!" O
The O
movie O
looks O
like O
a O
Sci-Fi B-GENRE
Channel O
original, O
probably O
because O
it O
was. O
The O
acting B-CAST
is O
actually O
pretty O
good. B-CAST
I O
particularly O
enjoyed O
Tamara O
Gorski O
as O
Tatoya; O
she O
was O
ruthless O
and O
cunning, O
yes, O
but O
seemed O
to O
have O
a O
tragic B-STORY
air O
about O
her O
in O
certain O
moments O
that O
the O
story B-STORY
never O
explored. O
Ted O
Raimi O
handled O
the O
standard O
"bumbling O
assistant" O
role O
admirably O
enough, O
and O
Bruce O
is O
funny B-HUMOR
as O
the O
arrogant, O
sardonic, B-HUMOR
condescending O
American O
jerk. O
(Now O
that O
he's O
writing B-STORY
his O
own O
films, O
you'd O
think O
he'd O
give O
himself O
a O
role O
that O
he O
hasn't O
been O
typecast O
in O
already.) O
Man O
with O
the O
Screaming O
Brain O
is O
a O
bizarre, O
nonsensical O
B-movie O
that O
ought O
to O
be O
enjoyable O
for O
anybody O
who O
can O
avoid O
taking O
a O
cinematic B-MUSIC
experience O
too O
seriously. O

You O
should O
never O
ever O
even O
consider O
to O
watch O
this O
movie! O
It O
is O
absolutely O
awful! O
This O
isn't O
an O
overstatement!! O
It O
is O
so O
unbelievable O
and O
exaggerated, O
it O
gets O
boring. B-TONE
It O
is O
just O
a O
movie O
where O
they O
have O
taken O
stories O
and O
plots O
from O
several O
movies O
and O
put O
it O
together O
in O
one. O
They O
writer O
hasn't O
been O
able O
to O
pull O
it O
off O
in O
a O
good B-CAST
way.<br O
/><br O
/>If O
you'd O
like O
to O
see O
pretty O
girls O
in O
bikinis O
and O
no O
brain O
this O
might O
be O
the O
movie O
for O
you, O
but O
still, O
you O
should O
plug O
your O
ears O
and O
just O
watch. O
It's O
not O
worth O
listening:p O
There O
are O
so O
many O
great O
movies O
out O
there, O
and O
if O
I O
could O
choose O
one, O
this O
would O
be O
the O
last O
movie O
I O
would O
pick. O
But O
all O
in O
all, O
it's O
your O
choice!!! O
<br O

Tell O
the O
truth O
I’m O
a O
bit O
stun O
to O
see O
all O
these O
positive O
review O
by O
so O
many O
people, O
which O
is O
also O
the O
main O
reason O
why O
I O
actually O
decide O
to O
see O
this O
movie. O
And O
after O
having O
seen O
it, O
I O
was O
really O
a O
disappointed, O
and O
this O
comes O
from O
the O
guy O
that O
loves O
this O
genre O
of O
movie.<br O
/><br O
/>I’m O
surprise O
at O
this O
movie O
all O
completely O
– O
it O
is O
like O
a O
kid’s O
movie O
with O
nudity O
for O
absolutely O
no O
reason O
and O
it O
all O
involve O
little O
children O
cursing O
and O
swearing. O
I’m O
not O
at O
all O
righteous O
but O
this O
has O
really O
gone O
too O
far O
in O
my O
account.<br O
/><br O
/>Synopsis: O
The O
story B-STORY
about O
two O
guys O
got O
send O
to O
the O
big O
brother O
program O
for O
their O
reckless O
behavior. O
There O
they O
met O
up O
with O
one O
kids O
with O
boobs O
obsession B-CLICHES
and O
the O
other O
is O
a O
medieval O
freak.<br O
/><br O
/>Just O
the O
name O
it O
self O
is O
not O
really O
connected O
with O
the O
story B-STORY
at O
all. O
They O
are O
not O
being O
a O
role O
model O
and O
or O
do O
anything O
but O
to O
serve O
their O
time O
for O
what O
they O
have O
done. O
The O
story B-STORY
is O
very O
predictable B-CLICHES
(though O
expected) O
and O
the O
humor O
is O
lame. O
And O
haven’t O
we O
already O
seen O
the O
same O
characters B-CAST
(play O
by O
Mc O
Lovin’) O
in O
so O
many O
other O
movies O
(like O
Sasquatch O
Gang?). O
I O
think O
I O
laugh O
thrice O
and O
almost O
fell O
a O
sleep.<br O
/><br O
/>Well O
the O
casting O
was O
alright O
after O
all O
he O
is O
the O
one O
that O
produce O
the O
screenplay. O
And O
the O
acting B-CAST
is O
so-so O
as O
expected O
when O
you’re O
watching O
this O
type O
of O
movie. O
And O
the O
direction, B-DIRECTION
what O
do O
one O
expect? O
This O
is O
the O
same O
guy O
who O
brought O
us O
Wet O
Hot O
American O
Summer, O
and O
that O
movie O
also O
sucks. O
But O
somehow O
he O
always O
managed O
to O
bring O
in O
some O
star O
to O
attract O
his O
horrendous O
movie.<br O
/><br O
/>Anyway O
I O
felt O
not O
total O
riff O
off O
but O
a O
completely O
waste O
of O
time. O
Only O
the O
naked O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
seem O
to O
be O
the O
best O
part O
in O
the O
movie. O
Can’t O
really O
see O
any O
point O
why O
I O
should O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone.<br O
/><br O
/>Pros: O
Elizabeth O
Bank? O
Two O
topless O
scenes.<br O
/><br O
/>Cons: O
Not O
funny, B-HUMOR
dreadful O
story, B-STORY
nudity O
and O
kids O
do O
not O
mix O
together.<br O

F) O

This O
film O
held O
my O
interest O
enough O
to O
watch O
it O
several O
times. O
The O
plot B-CLICHES
has O
holes, B-STORY
but O
the O
lead O
performers O
make O
it O
work.<br O
/><br O
/>Catherine O
Mary O
Stewart B-CAST
(Julia O
Kerbridge), O
does O
a O
great O
job O
as O
a O
woman O
of O
37 O
who O
has O
sacrificed O
everything O
else O
to O

physician. O
She O
worked O
years O

school. O
She O
is O
performing O
brilliantly O

just O
about O

take O
her O
board O

realize O
her O
dream.<br O
/><br O

Julia's O

brother-in-law O
are O
murdered O

as O
the O
nearest O
living O

she O
is O
compelled O
to O
take O
in O
her O
niece O
Amanda O
(Arlen O
Aguayo-Stewart) O
to O
avoid O
having O
her O
become O
a O
ward O
of O
the O
state. O
Amanda O
is O
about O
7 O
years O
old O
from O
her O
appearance. O
Amanda O
is O
so O
traumatized O
from O
her O
parent's O
murder B-GENRE
that O
she O
has O
become O
mute. O
Needless O
to O
say, O
Julia's O
16-hour O
days O
get O
longer O
caring O
for O
Amanda.<br O

Lowe O
plays O
Kevin O

building O
who O
works O
his O
way O
into O

with O

trick O
or O
a O
joke O
to O
help O
Amanda O
deal O
with O

distress. O
Amanda O
really O
starts O
to O
warm O
up O
to O
Kevin O
as O
the O
film O
progresses, O
perhaps O
more O
than O
to O
her O

Julia O
starts O
to O
rely O
on O
Kevin O
to O
take O
some O
of O
the O
load O

for O

/><br O
/>The O
chemistry O
between O

The O
chemistry O
between O

well. O
Arlen O
managed O
to O
convey O
quite O
a O
lot O
without O
the O

The O
plot B-CLICHES
had O
Julia O
and O
Amanda O
gradually O
warming O
up O
to O
each O
other. O
You O
can O
see O

working O
out O
a O
relationship O
as O

progresses.<br O
/><br O

discover O
that O
Julia's O

industrial B-MUSIC

They O
stole O
an O

were O
planning O
to O
skip O

The O

is O
unclear O
whether O

and O
greatly O
improved O
the O
effort. O

Like O
the O
previous O
poster, O
I O
am O
from O
northern O
Vermont, O
and O
I O
was O
inclined O
to O
like O
this O
film. O
However, O
not O
since O
"Red O
Zone O
Cuba" O
have O
I O
seen O
such O
a O
confusing O
plot. B-CLICHES
The O
things O
the O
people O
to O
bootleg O
make O
no O
sense. O
Two O
of O
the O
gang O
paddle O
across O
the O
border O
send O
a O
second O
party O
across O
in O
a O
car. O
Uhm, O
why? O
Then O
they O
meet O
two O
others, O
and O
drive O
up O
at O
night B-STORY
in O
to O
the O
bad O
guy's O
hideout O
in O
a O
luxury O
Packard. O
--Wouldn't O
just O
two O
people O
in O
a O
flatbed O
truck O
make O
more O
sense? O
Then, O
parked O
outside O
the O
garage O
that O
holds O
the O
targeted O
hooch, O
the O
four O
fall O
asleep! O
When O
they O
waken O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
and O
start O
hauling O
the O
whiskey O
out, O
of O
course O
they're O
spotted O
and O
shot O
at, O
losing O
some O
of O
their O
precious O
cargo O
in O
the O
process. O
Then O
two O
of O
the O
smugglers O
put O
the O
whiskey O
in O
a O
boat O
and O
float O
it O
over O
the O
border. O
Again, O
why? O
I O
am O
told O
by O
someone O
whose O
great O
uncle O
really O
did O
smuggle O
in O
the O
area, O
all O
one O
needed O
was O
to O
drive O
a O
vehicle O
that O
could O
outrun O
than O
the O
U.S. O
Canada O
Border O
Patrol, O
which O
back O
then O
had O
a O
fraction O
of O
the O
resources O
it O
has O
now. O
<br O
/><br O
/>And O
don't O
get O
me O
started O
on O
the O
last O
half O
hour, O
which O
made O
no O
sense O
whatsoever.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
only O
good B-CAST
thing O
I O
can O
say O
about O
the O
film O
is O
that O
Kris O
Kristopherson O
has O
actually O
grown O
some O
charisma O
with O
the O

MAY O
CONTAIN O

This O
movie O
was O
the O
worst O
movie O
ever. O
I O
couldn't O
even O
watch O
it O
all O
it O
was O
so O
bad. O
This O
film O
is O
actually O
worse O
than O
scarecrow O

which O
is O
saying O
a O
whole O

This O
was O
worse O
than O
terror O
toons O
which O
at O
least O
terror O
toons O
was O
funny B-HUMOR
at O
times. O
Not O
even O
the O
gore B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
in O
the O

was O
good. B-CAST
The O
shootings O
were O
fake O
and O
the O
acting B-CAST
was O
worse. O
Please O
do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
skip O
this O
one. O
If O
you O
see O
it O
at O
the O
rental O

then O
run O
the O
other O
way. O
There O
is O
nothing O
good B-CAST
about O
this O
film O
at O
all. O
If O
you O
want O
to O
see O
a O
good B-CAST
scarecrow O
movie O
then O
watch O
Night B-STORY

the O
scarecrow O

If O
you O
want O
to O
see O

watch O

I O
rate O
this O

10. O
That's O
how O
horrible O
this O

really O
is. O
THE O
WORST O
MOVIE O
EVER. O

Watched O
this O

was O
bowled O
over O
by O
the O

as O
a O

/><br O
/>Without O
giving O
away O
too O
much O
of O
the O

about O

<br O

story B-STORY
has O
a O
prologue O
about O
what O
dancing O
in O
Japan O
symbolizes O
sociologically, O
so O
it O
isn't O
exactly O
as O
simple O

Japan O
as O
it O

here O
in O

U.S. O
<br O

film O
is O
lighthearted; B-TONE
you'll O
laugh O
out O
loud O
at O
some O
of O
the O
sight O
gags. O
Yet O
it O
is O
also O
dignified O
in O
a O
way O
hard O
to O
describe. O
All O
of O
the O
film's O

are O
taken O
seriously, O

been O

Recap: O
Something O
mysteriously O
dense O
that O
transmits O
radio O
signals O
is O
discovered O
in O
the O
ice O
of O
Antarctica. O
The O
mysterious O
block O
is O
dug O
out O
and O
brought O
to O
a O
research O
station O
on O
Antarctica. O
Julian O
Rome, O
a O
former O
SETI-worker, O
is O
brought O
in O
to O
decipher O
the O
message. O
Problem O
is O
that O
one O
of O
the O
researchers O
is O
a O
old O
girlfriend O
of O
his, O
and O
the O
situation O
quickly O
turns O
awkward, O
especially O
since O
the O
other O
female O
researchers O
practically O
throw O
themselves O
at O
him. O
And O
the O
block O
of O
ice O
with O
the O
thing O
inside O
is O
melting O
unnaturally O
quickly. O
Soon O
the O
object O
is O
in O
the O
open. O
The O
mystery B-STORY
continues O
though O
as O
the O
object O
generates O
a O
huge O
amount O
of O
electricity. O
It O
is O
decided O
to O
open O
the O
object, O
but O
just O
before O
that O
is O
done, O
Julian O
decodes O
the O
signal. O
"Do O
not O
open". O
But O
too O
late, O
and O
the O
object O
explodes O
as O
it O
is O
finally O
breached, O
and O
two O
things O
unleashed O
on O
earth. O
The O
first O
is O
an O
alien, O
that O
had O
been O
dormant O
in O
the O
object, O
and O
the O
other O
is O
a O
virus B-STORY
that O
instantly O
kills O
the O
research O
staff. O
And O
Washington, O
that O
is O
suspiciously O
updated O
on O
this O
historic O
event, O
decides O
that O
those O
things O
can O
not O
be O
unleashed O
upon O
the O
earth. O
So O
a O
Russian O
nuclear O
submarine, O
carrying O
nuclear O
weapons O
is O
sent O
to O
Antarctica.<br O

The O
movie O
holds O
a O
few O
surprises. O
One O
is O
Carl O
Lewis O
who O
surprisingly O
puts O
in O
a O
good B-CAST
acting B-CAST
performance, B-CAST
and O
the O
other O
is O
that O
the O
special B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
effects O
that O
are O
beautiful, O
well O
worked O
through O
and O
a O
lot O
better O
than O
expected. O
Unfortunately O
the O
story B-STORY
holds O
a O
lot O
of O
surprises O
of O
its O
own, O
and O
this O
time O
not O
in O
a O
good B-CAST
way. O
Actually O
it O
is O
so O
full O
of O
plot B-CLICHES
holes B-STORY
that O
sometimes O
the O
movies O
seem O
to O
consist O
of O
almost O
randomly O
connected O
scenes. B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
It O
is O
never O
really O
explained O
why O
Washington O
know O
so O
much, O
why O
Washington O
is O
able O
to O
command O
Russian O
submarines, O
why O
the O
object O
is O
in O
the O
Antarctic O
and O
has O
woken O
up O
now. O
It O
is O
really O
puzzling O
that O
the O
alien O
pod O
is O
transmitting O
in O
understandable O
English. O
Some O
might O
want O
to O
explain O
this O
with O
that O
the O
alien O
had O
been O
to O
Earth O
before O
and O
knew O
the O
language O
(and O
obviously O
chose O
English, O
why?). O
But O
then O
it O
is O
very O
confusing O
why O
the O
nice O
aliens O
that O
apparently O
want O
to O
save O
the O
Earth O
from O
the O
virus, B-STORY
send O
their O
"Do O
not O
open" O
message O
encoded! O
And O
finally O
the O
end O
is O
as O
open O
as O
an O
end O
can O
be.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
movie O
is O
a O
little O
entertaining O
but O
too O
much O
energy O
(from O
me) O
must O
be O
diverted O
to O
fill O
in O
the O
voids O
in O
the O
plot. B-CLICHES
Therefore O
the O
total O
impression O
of O
the O
movie O
is O
not O
too O
good.<br O

This O

Beyond O

it O

a O
truly O
bad O

dull, B-TONE
unrealistic O

That O

Had O
I O
checked O
IMDb O
BEFORE O
renting O
this O
DVD O
from O
Netflix, O
I'd O
have O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
of O
my O
life O
back. O
I'm O
frankly O
suspicious O
when O
I O
see O
that O
a O
film's O
director B-DIRECTION
also O
wrote O
it. O
In O
this O
case, O
according O
to O
the O
credits, O
the O
same O
guy O
was O
"writter O
and O
director" B-DIRECTION
- O
unfortunately, O
an O
indication O
of O
the O
overall O
quality O
of O
this O
production. O
There O
were O
a O
few O
interesting O
moments O
(e.g., O
Judy O
Tenuta's O
scene O
reminded O
of O
her O
early O
comedy B-GENRE
routines O
touting O
Judy-ism) O
which O
led O
me O
to O
rate O
this O
two O
stars O
rather O
than O
one. O
Those O
moments, O
however, O
were O
few O
and O
far O
between O
... O
and O
I O
almost O
did O
not O
get O
to O
see O
them O
because O
the O
opening O
sequence O
was O
nearly O
incomprehensible O
to O
me, O
not O
to O
mention O
reprehensible O
in O
its O
violence. B-GENRE
I O
admit O
I O
went O
back O
to O
watch O
that O
part O
again O
to O
see O
if O
I O
had O
missed O
something O
that O
would O
help O
me O
figure O
it O
out O
once O
I'd O
seen O
the O
whole O
thing. O
Nope, O
though O
I O
at O
least O
recognized O
who O
the O
characters B-CAST
were O
who O
would O
turn O
out O
to O
be O
important O
later. O
The O
"spinning B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
camera" B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
technique B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
was O
overused O
and O
essentially O
pointless. O
I O
found O
myself O
talking O
to O
the O
TV O
screen: O
"What?!?" O
or O
"For O
goodness O
sake, O
get O
ON O
with O
it!" O
Not O
recommended. O

The O
endless O
bounds O
of O
our O
inhumanity O
to O
our O
own O
kind O
never O
fails O
to O
stun O
me. O
This O
truly O
astonishing O
story B-STORY
of O
a O
horrifically O
abused O
and O
largely O
unheard-of O
population O
is O
compelling, O
well-documented O
and O
enraging. O
As O
an O
American, O
I O
am O
constantly O
humiliated O
by O
my O
country's O
behaviour O
and O
this O
is O
just O
another O
in O
our O
long O
catalogue O
of O
international O
debasement. O
We O
suck. O
This O
is O
probably O
the O
first O
John O
Pilger O
documentary O
I've O
seen, O
but O
it O
immediately O
made O
me O
want O
to O
see O
what O
else O
he's O
done. O
My O
only O
complaint, O
and O
the O
reason O
I O
gave O
this O
film O
only O
8 O
out O
of O
10, O
is O
that O
Pilger O
shows O
us O
this O
travesty O
and O
the O
appalling O
collaboration O
of O
the O
US O
and O
UK O
governments, O
demands O
that O
we O
viewers/citizens O
are O
complicit O
in O
our O
own O
inaction...but O
makes O
no O
suggestion O
of O
how O
to O
help. O
I O
don't O
know O
about O
Britain, O
but O
America's O
made O
it O
nearly O
impossible O
for O
the O
citizenry O
to O
take O
part O
in O
their O
government's O
doings. O
A O
gesture O
in O
the O
right O
direction B-DIRECTION
might O
help O
these O
islanders' O
cause. O

This O
flick O
is O
so O
bad O
its O
beyond O
belief.Even O
for O
an O
independent O
low O
budget O

just, O
well, O
sucks.I O
can't O
even O
believe O
even O
Troma O
would O
put O
out O
such O
crap.I O
have O
been O
a O
fan O
of O
some O
Troma O
flicks O
for O
years(Toxic O
Avenger,Squeeze O

to O
name O
a O
few).But O
LLoyd, O
come O
on,this O
goes O
way O
beyond O
the O
boundaries O
of O
any O
taste.It O
features O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
acting B-CAST

think O
it O
would O
have O
been O
possible O

that O
is O
what O
they O
did.I O
mean O
it,these O
characters B-CAST
have O
negative O
charisma.With O
any O
luck, O
the O
producer O
and O
director B-DIRECTION
of O
this O
film O
will O
have O
a O
huge O
karmic O

of O
this O
atrocity.As O

beyond O
the O
terrible O
acting B-CAST
and O
the O
horrid O
special B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
effects,the O
dialogue O
is O
absolutely O
traumatic O
to O
the O
ears.The O
script B-STORY
is O
full O
of O
plot B-CLICHES
holes B-STORY
the O
size O
of O
Alaska, O
and O
there O
are O
severe O
continuity B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
problems.The O
worst O
part O
however, O
is O
that O
it O
not O
entertaining O
in O
even O
the O
smallest O
way.And O
this O
is O
the O
most O
unforgivable O
sin O
in O

don't O
take O
my O

don't O

I O

This O
is O
a O
very O
memorable B-MUSIC
spaghetti O
western. B-FRANCHISE
It O
has O
a O
great O
storyline, O
interesting O
characters, B-CAST
and O
some O
very O
good B-CAST
acting, B-CAST
especially O
from O
Rosalba O
Neri. B-CAST
Her O
role O
as O
the O
evil O
villainess B-PERFORMANCE
in O
this O
film O
is O
truly O
classic. B-GENRE
She O
steals O
every O
scene O
she O
is O
in, O
and O
expresses O
so O
much O
with O
her O
face O
and O
eyes, O
even O
when O
she's O
not O
speaking. O
Her O
performance B-CAST
is O
very O
believable. B-PERFORMANCE
She O
manages O
to O
be O
quite O
mesmerizing O
without O
being O
over O
the O
top O
(not O
that O
there's O
anything O
wrong O
with O
being O
over O
the O
top). O
Mark O
Damon O
is O
surprisingly O
good B-CAST
in O
this O
movie O
too.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
music B-MUSIC
score B-MUSIC
is O
excellent, O
and O
the O
theme B-MUSIC
song O
is O
the O
kind O
that O
will O
be O
playing O
in O
your O
head O
constantly O
for O
days O
after O
seeing O
the O
movie, O
whether O
you O
want O
it O
to O
or O
not. O
There O
are O
a O
couple O
of O
parts O
that O
are O
very O
amusing. O
I O
especially O
like O
the O
part O
where O
Rosalba O
Neri B-CAST
undresses O
in O
front O
of O
the O
parrot. O
There's O
also O
lots O
of O
slick O
gun-play O
that's O
very O
well O
done.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
would O
probably O
have O
given O
this O
movie O
8 O
or O
9 O
stars O
if O
it O
wasn't O
for O
two O
things. O
The O
first O
being O
a O
silly O
bar O
room O
brawl O
that O
occurs O
about O
25 O
minutes O
into O
the O
film. O
This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
ridiculous B-TONE
looking O
fights O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
a O
movie. O
It O
is O
very O
poorly O
choreographed, O
and O
looks O
more O
like O
a O
dance O
number O
from O
a O
bad O
musical B-REMAKES
than O
any O
kind O
of O
a O
real O
fight. B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
One O
might O
be O
able O
to O
overlook O
this O
if O
it O
were O
a O
Terence O
Hill/Bud O
Spencer O
comedy, B-GENRE
but O
this O
is O
a O
more O
serious O
western, B-FRANCHISE
and O
the O
brawl O
really O
needed O
to O
be O
more O
realistic. O
The O
other O
thing O
that O
annoyed O
me O
about O
this O
movie O
was O
Yuma's O
cowardly O
Mexican O
sidekick. O
I O
guess O
he O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
comic B-HUMOR
relief O
or O
something, O
but O
the O
character O
was O
just O
plain O
stupid O
and O
unnecessary O
in O
a O
movie O
like O
this, O
and O
he O
wasn't O
at O
all O
funny. B-HUMOR
All O
I O
can O
say O
is O
where O
is O
Tuco O
when O
you O
need O
him? O
<br O
/><br O
/>All O
that O
having O
been O
said, O
let O
me O
assure O
everyone O
reading O
this O
that O
Johnny O
Yuma O
is O
a O
classic B-GENRE
spaghetti O
western B-FRANCHISE
despite O
the O
faults O
I O
have O
mentioned, O
and O
all O
fans O
of O
the O
genre O
need O
to O
see O
this O
movie. O

The O
plot: B-CLICHES
Michael O
Linnett O
Connors O
has O
done O
everything O
in O
films O
but O
direct, O
and O
is O
looking O
for O
his O
1st O
big O
chance. O
He O
discovers O
Molly O
in O
a O
play O
and O
at O
once O
knows O
she O
will O
be O
a O
big O
film O
star. O
He O
signs O
her O
to O
a O
contract O
with O
the O
stipulation O
that O
he O
must O
direct. O
The O
producer O
agrees O
and O
their O
big O
time O
careers O
are O
under O
way. O
What O
follows O
is O
a O
recreation B-REMAKES
of O
the O
silent B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
film O
era O
and O
early O
sound O
movies O
with O
great O
emphasis O
on O
comedy. B-GENRE
And, O
oh O
yes, O
there's O
romance, B-STORY
and O
a O
little O
sadness O
too. O
The O
performances O
by O
Don O
Ameche O
and O
Alice O
Fay O
are O
top O
notch. O
The O
music B-MUSIC
is O
a O
real O
plus O
too O
with O
some O
old O
familiar O
tunes O
heard. O
Lots O
of O
DVD O
extras O
as O
well O
in O
this O
restored O
version O
released O
in O
2008. O
It O
must O
be O
emphasized O
that O
this O
movie O
is O
a O
story B-STORY
1st, O
not O
just O
a O
tribute O
to O
silent B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
films. O
Later O
years O
would O
bring O
similar O
films O
such O
as, O
Singin' O
in O
the O
Rain(1952) O
& O
Dick O
Van O
Dyke-Carl O
Reiner's, O
The O
Comic(1969). O
What O
is O
special B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
about O
this O
film, O
though, O
is O
recreating O
silent B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
movies O
in O
1939. O
We O
see O
portions O
of O
them O
as O
the O
cinema O
audience O
would O
in O
that O
bygone O
era(although O
some O
sound O
effects O
are O
included)in O
glorious O
b&w, O
while O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
movie O
is O
in O
pristine O
color. O
One O
of O
the O
greatest O
in O
the O
silent B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
era, O
Buster O
Keaton, B-DIRECTION
who O
at O
this O
point O
was O
on O
an O
uphill O
climb, O
is O
used O
superbly O
in O
2 O
silent B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
film O
recreated B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
and O
he O
is O
on O
the O
top O
of O
his O
game! O
It O
is O
said O
that O
he O
had O
some O
input O
on O
his O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
as O
well. O
But O
the O
real O
reason O
to O
watch O
the O
movie, O
if O
your O
a O
motion B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
picture O
history O
fan, O
is O
that O
beyond O
everything O
else, O
Hollywood O
Cavalcade O
is O
Mack O
Sennett's O
film O
legacy. B-FRANCHISE
It O
doesn't O
take O
a O
genius O
to O
realize O
this O
movie O
is O
a O
"positive" O
reworking O
of O
Mack O
Sennett's O
and O
Mabel O
Normand's O
life. O
The O
character O
Michael O
"Linnett" O
Connors O
is O
Mack O
Sennett, O
whose O
real O
name O
was O
Michael O
Sinnott. O
And O
Molly, O
of O
course O
is O
Mabel. O
Sennett O
had O
the O
pie O
throwings, O
the O
bathing O
beauties O
and O
Keystone O
Cops. O
He O
worked O
with O
Buster O
Keaton, B-DIRECTION
Ben O
Turpin(cameo), O
Roscoe O
"Fatty" O
Arbuckle(body O
double) O
and O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
his O
leading O
lady. O
Not O
only O
all O
that, O
but O
Sennett O
was O
technical O
adviser O
for O
this O
film O
and O
appears O
in O
it O
as O
well. O
As O
most O
film O
viewers O
today O
prefer O
sound O
features, O
those O
who O
were O
associated O
with O
short B-CAST
subjects O
and O
silents O
are O
left O
out O
to O
pasture. O
As O
Mack O
Sennett O
fell O
into O
that O
category, O
it O
is O
fortunate O
that O
there O
is O
Hollywood O
Cavalcade! O
Sennett O
was O
of O
course O
very O
instrumental O
in O
the O
evolution O
of O
comedy B-GENRE
in O
movies. O
His O
career O
started O
in O
1908 O
as O
an O
actor, B-CAST
then O
writer, O
director B-DIRECTION
& O
producer. O
He O
semi O
retired O
in O
1935 O
with O
about O
500 O
films O
to O
his O
credit. O
He O
had O
worked O
with O
the O
best, O
such O
as O
Charlie O
Chaplin, O
Gloria O
Swanson, O
Bing O
Crosby, O
W.C. O
Fields, O
Keaton, B-DIRECTION
Harry O
Langdon, O
Arbuckle, O
and O
even O
Roy O
Rogers(in O
Way O
Up O
Thar).As O
film O
comedy B-GENRE
is O
an O
extremely O
difficult O
path O
to O
continue O
for O
an O
entire O
career, O
Mack O
played O
it O
wise O
& O
did O
only O
selective O
work O
for O
the O
next O
25 O
years. O
In O
1931 O
he O
had O
receive O
an O
academy O
award O
in O
the O
short B-CAST
subject O
category, O
and O
another O
in O
1937 O
for O
a O
lifetime O
of O
work. O
In O
the O
1940's O
his O
presence O
was O
still O
felt, O
e.g. O
Here O
Come O
the O
Co-Eds(1945)where O
a O
recreation B-REMAKES
of O
the O
oyster O
soup O
scene O
used O
in O
Mack's O
Wandering O
Willies(1926)is O
done. O
In O
1947, O
The O
Road O
to O
Hollywood, O
used O
some O
of O
Sennett's O
Crosby O
films. O
2 O
years O
later O
brought O
some O
nostalgia B-REMAKES
with O
the O
film O
Down O
Memory O
Lane O
in O
which O
he O
participated. O
With O
his O
knack O
of O
always O
associating O
with O
the O
right O
people, O
a O
guest O
role O
with O
the O
eternally O
popular O
Lawrence O
Welk O
& O
his O
radio O
show O
came O
about O
later O
in O
the O
year. O
1950 O
brought O
a O
re-release O
of O
his O
greatest O
triumph, O
Tillie's O
Punctured O
Romance(1914) O
with O
sound. O
In O
1952 O
he O
was O
honored O
on O
TV's, O
This O
Is O
Your O
Life, O
then O
his O
autobiography, O
The O
King O
of O
Comedy(1954), O
which O
is O
a O
great O
companion O
piece O
to O
Hollywood O
Cavalcade, O
was O
published. O
1955 O
brought O
a O
more O
concrete O
association O
with O
Abbott O
& O
Costello, O
as O
he O
had O
a O
cameo O
in O
A&C O
Meet O
the O
Keystone O
Kops. O
Finally O
in O
1957, O
another O
tribute O
with O
the O
compilation O
film, O
The O
Golden O
Age O
of O
Comedy. B-GENRE
So O
when O
you O
watch O
Hollywood O
Cavalcade O
it O
is O
the O
legacy B-FRANCHISE
of O
a O
motion B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
picture O
pioneer. O
In O
the O
film O
at O
the O
banquet O
scene O
the O
camera B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
pans O
over O
the O
guests O
at O
a O
long O
table. O
As O
we O
get O
to O
the O
silver O
haired O
Mack, O
he O
alone O
turns O
his O
head O
to O
the O
camera B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
as O
if O
to O
say, O
"here O
I O
am!". O
When O
he O
rises O
to O
give O
a O
speech O
a O
short B-CAST
while O
later, O
he O
is O
at O
his O
most O
subdued, B-PERFORMANCE
underplaying O
the O
words O
given O
him O
as O
if O
to O
mentally O
convey, O
"I O
know O
my O
influence O
on O
comedy B-GENRE
will O
never O
end, O
but O
will O
people O
forget O
Mack O
Sennett O
the O
individual. O
Maybe O
this O
movie O
will O
help." O

It O
got O
to O
be O
a O
running O
joke O
around O
Bonanza O
about O
how O
fatal O
it O
was O
for O
any O
women O
to O
get O
involved O
with O
any O
Cartwright O
men. O
After O
all O
Ben O
Cartwright O
was O
three O
times O
a O
widower O
with O
a O
son O
by O
each O
marriage. O
And O
any O
woman O
who O
got O
involved O
with O
Adam, O
Hoss, O
and O
Little O
Joe O
were O
going O
to O
end O
up O
dying O
because O
we O
couldn't O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
formula O
of O
the O
widower O
and O
the O
three O
sons O
that O
started O
this O
classic B-GENRE
TV O
western.<br O
/><br O
/>Perhaps O
if O
Bonanza O
were O
being O
done O
today O
the O
writers O
would O
have O
had O
revolving O
women O
characters B-CAST
who O
came O
in O
and O
out O
of O
the O
lives O
of O
the O
Cartwrights. O
People O
have O
relationships, O
some O
go O
good, B-CAST
some O
not O
so O
good, B-CAST
it's O
just O
life. O
And O
we're O
less O
demanding O
of O
our O
heroes O
today O
so O
if O
a O
relationship O
with O
one O
of O
them O
goes O
south O
we O
don't O
have O
to O
kill O
the O
character O
off O
to O
keep O
the O
survivor's O
nobility O
intact. O
But O
that's O
if O
Bonanza O
were O
done O
today.<br O
/><br O
/>But O
we O
were O
still O
expecting O
a O
lot O
from O
our O
western B-FRANCHISE
heroes O
and O
Bonanza O
though O
it O
took O
a O
while O
to O
take O
hold O
and O
a O
change O
of O
viewing O
time O
from O
NBC O
certainly O
helped, O
the O
secret O
of O
Bonanza's O
success O
was O
the O
noble B-GENRE
patriarch O
Ben O
Cartwright O
and O
his O
stalwart O
sons. O
Ben O
Cartwright O
was O
THE O
ideal O
TV O
Dad O
in O
any O
genre O
you O
want O
to O
name. O
His O
whole O
life O
was O
spent O
in O
the O
hard O
work O
of O
building O
that O
immense O

children. O
The O
kids O
were O
all O
different O
in O
personality, O
but O
all O
came O
together O
in O
a O
pinch.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
Cartwrights O
became O
and O
still O
are O
an O
American O
institution. O
I O
daresay O
more O
people O
cared O
about O
this O
family B-FRANCHISE
than O
the O
Kennedys. O
Just O
the O
popularity O
that O
Bonanza O
has O
in O
syndication O
testifies O
to O
that. O
<br O
/><br O
/>Pernell O
Roberts O
as O
oldest O
son O
Adam O
was O
written O
out O
of O
the O
show. O
Rumor O
has O
it O
he O
didn't O
care O
for O
the O
noble B-GENRE
Cartwright O
characters B-CAST
which O
he O
felt O
bordered O
on O
sanctimonious. O
Perhaps O
if O
it O
were O
done O
now, O
he'd O
have O
liked O
it O
better O
in O
the O
way O
I O
describe.<br O
/><br O
/>This O
was O
just O
the O
beginning O
for O
Michael O
Landon, O
how O
many O
people O
get O
three O
hit O
TV O
shows O
to O
their O
credit. O
Landon O
also O
has O
Highway O
to O
Heaven O
and O
Little O
House O
On O
the O
Prarie O
where O
he O
had O
creative B-DIRECTION
control. O
Little O
Joe O
was O
the O
youngest, O
most O
hot O
headed, O
but O
the O
most O
romantic B-FRANCHISE
of O
the O
Cartwrights. O
<br O
/><br O
/>When O
Roberts O
left. O
the O
show O
kept O
going O
with O
the O
two O
younger O
sons, O
but O
when O
big O
Dan O
Blocker O
left, O
the O
heart O
went O
out O
of O
Bonanza. O
Other O
characters B-CAST
had O
been O
added O
on O
by O
that O
time, O
David O
Canary, O
Tim O
Matheson, O
and O
Ben O
Cartwright O
adopted O
young O
Mitch O
Vogel. O
But O
big, O
loyal, O
but O
a O
little O
thick O
Hoss O
was O
easily O
the O
most O
lovable O
of O
the O
Cartwrights. O
His O
sudden O
demise O
after O
surgery O
left O
too O
big O
a O
hole O
in O
that O
family.<br O
/><br O
/>So O
the O
Cartwrights O
of O
the O
Ponderosa O
have O
passed O
into O
history. O
I O
got O
a O
real O
taste O
of O
how O
America O
took O
the O
Cartwrights O
to O
heart O
when O
I O
visited O
the O
real O
Virginia O
City. O
It O
doesn't O
look O
anything O
like O
what O
you O
see O
in O
Bonanza. O
But O
near O
Lake O
Tahoe, O
just O
about O
where O
you O
see O
the O
Ponderosa O
on O
the O
map O
at O
the O
opening O
credits, O
is O
the O
Cartwright O
home, O
the O
set O
maintained O
and O
open O
as O
a O
tourist O
attraction. O
Like O
21 O
Baker O
Street O
for O
Sherlock O
Holmes O
fans, O
the O
ranchhouse O
and O
the O
Cartwrights O
are O
real.<br O
/><br O
/>And O
if O
they O
weren't O
real, O
they O
should O
have O
been. O

Years O
ago, O
when O
DARLING O
LILI O
played O
on O
TV, O
it O
was O
always O
the O
pan O
and O
scan O
version, O
which O
I O
hated O
and O
decided O
to O
wait O
and O
see O
the O
film O
in O
its O
proper O
widescreen O
format. O
So O
when O
I O
saw O
an O
inexpensive O
DVD O
of O
this O
Julie O
Andrews/Blake O
Edwards B-DIRECTION
opus, O
I O
decided O
to O
purchase O
and O
watch O
it O
once O
and O
for O
all.<br O
/><br O
/>Boy, O
what O
a O
terrible O
film. O
It's O
so O
bad O
and O
on O
so O
many O
levels O
that O
I O
really O
do O
not O
know O
where O
to O
start O
in O
describing O
where O
and O
when O
it O
goes O
so O
horribly O
wrong. O
Looking O
at O
it O
now, O
it's O
obvious O
to O
any O
fans O
of O
movies O
that O
Blake O
Edwards B-DIRECTION
created O
this O
star O
vehicle O
for O
his O
wife O
simply O
because O
so O
many O
other O
directors O
had O
struck O
gold O
with O
Andrews O
in O
musicals O
(MARY O
POPPINS, O
SOUND O
OF O
MUSIC, B-MUSIC
THOROUGHLY O
MODERN O
MILLIE, O
etc) O
but O
also O
because O
Andrews O
was O
snubbed O
from O
starring O
in O
projects O
made O
famous O
on O
stage O
by O
Julie O
herself O
(CAMELOT, O
MY O
FAIR O
LADY, O
etc) O
because O
Hollywood O
thought O
she O
wasn't O
sexy O
or O
glamorous O
enough. O
So O
Blake O
created O
this O
stillborn O
effort, O
to O
showcase O
his O
wife O
in O
a O
bizarre O
concoction O
of O
spy B-GENRE
story/war O
movie/romance/slapstick O
comedy/musical. O
DARLING O
LILI O
suffers O
from O
multiple O
personalities, O
never O
knowing O
who O
or O
what O
it O
is. O
Some O
specific O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
are O
good B-CAST
or O
effective O
but O
as O
a O
whole, O
it O
just O
doesn't O
work O
at O
all O
to O
a O
point O
of O
it O
being O
very O
embarrassing.<br O
/><br O
/>Mind O
you, O
the O
version O
on O
the O
DVD O
is O
the O
"director's O
cut", O
or O
in O
this O
case, O
"let's O
salvage O
whatever O
we O
can" O
from O
this O
notorious O
box O
office O
flop. O
In O
releasing O
the O
DVD, O
Edwards B-DIRECTION
cut O
19 O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
(19!!!!!!!!) O
from O
the O
original O
bloated O
theatrical O
version O
into O
this O
more O
streamlined O
and O
yet O
remarkably O
ineffective O
version. O
The O
film O
moves O
along O
with O
no O
idea O
of O
what O
it O
is. O
We O
are O
25 O
minutes O
into O
it O
and O
we O
still O
don't O
know O
what's O
going O
on O
or O
why O
we're O
watching O
what's O
going. O
What O
kind O
of O
spy B-GENRE
is O
Lili? O
How O
powerful O
is O
she? O
Was O
she O
ever O
responsible O
for O
someone's O
death? O
Instead O
we O
watch O
a O
thoroughly O
bored O
looking O
Rock O
Hudson O
trying O
to O
woo O
a O
thoroughly O
bored O
looking O
Julie O
Andrews. O
Things O
aren't O
helped O
much O
with O
the O
inexplicable O
reason O
why O
the O
two O
fall O
in O
love. O
Why O
does O
Julie O
fall O
for O
Hudson? O
Why O
him O
and O
not O
other O
men O
she O
got O
involved O
with? O
There O
should O
have O
been O
one O
of O
her O
ex O
hanging O
around, O
trying O
to O
win O
her O
back O
or O
trying O
to O
decipher O
her O
secret. O
This O
would O
have O
given O
us O
some O
much O
needed O
contrast O
to O
the O
muddled O
action. B-GENRE
It O
would O
also O
have O
given O
us O
some O
impetuous O
to O
the O
sluggish O
proceedings. O
There's O
no O
catalyst O
in O
this O
story.<br O
/><br O
/>One O
only O
has O
to O
look O
at O
the O
cut O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
to O
clearly O
see O
that O
Edwards B-DIRECTION
and O
the O
writer O
just O
came O
up O
with O
ideas O
inspired O
by O
Andrews' O
(and O
Edwards') B-DIRECTION
previous O
successes. O
The O
best O
(or O
worst) O
example O
is O
the O
scene O
when O
Andrews O
and O
Hudson O
follows O
a O
group O
of O
children O
who O
sing O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
forest. O
Edwards B-DIRECTION
channeling O
SOUND O
OF O
MUSIC. B-MUSIC
It's O
no O
wonder O
he O
removed O
it O
from O
the O
DVD. O
Back O
in O
1970, O
that O
scene O
might O
have O
worked O
on O
a O
certain O
level O
but O
today, O
that O
moment O
reeks O
of O
desperation. O
There O
are O
other O
plot B-CLICHES
elements O
directly O
inspired O
by O
Andrews/Edwards O
other O
films. O
The O
endless O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
of O
dogfights O
is O
inspired O
by O
the O
much O
better O
MODERN O
MILLIE. O
The O
musical B-REMAKES
moment O
"I'll O
give O
you O
three O
guesses" O
was O
created O
just O
to O
make O
fun B-PERFORMANCE
of O
Julie's O
MARY O
POPPINS O
persona, O
which O
is O
turned O
"raunchy" B-TONE
with O
Julie O
doing O
a O
striptease O
in O
the O
act. O
The O
ending, O
bird's O
eye O
view O
of O
Julie O
running O
towards O
Hudson's O
plane, O
is O
another O
"wink" O
at O
SOUND O
OF O
MUSIC.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
whole O
thing O
is O
confusing. O
Julie O
plays O
a O
singer, O
born O
from O
a O
German O
father O
and O
British O
mother, O
who O
lives O
in O
England O
but O
sings O
her O
(English) O
songs B-MUSIC
in O
Paris. O
You O
never O
know O
exactly O
where O
the O
story B-STORY
takes O
place. O
Some O
moments O
are O
just O
badly O
edited. O
Like O
when O
Julie O
and O
her O
"uncle" O
are O
on O
horseback. O
They O
talk O
and O
talk O
and O
then O
Julie O
suddenly O
sprints O
off O
in O
mid-sentence. O
I'm O
like O
"what O
happened O
here?"<br O
/><br O
/>The O
comedy B-GENRE
bits O
are O
unfunny O
and O
cringe-worthy. B-HUMOR
Every O
scene O
with O
the O
French O
police O
are O
pathetic. O
Where's O
Peter O
Sellers O
when O
you O
really O
need O
him. O
The O
action B-GENRE
is O
stupid O
beyond O
belief. O
When O
Julie O
and O
her O
"uncle" O
are O
on O
their O
way O
to O
Germany O
on O
that O
train, O
Hudson's O
squadron O
shoots O
rounds O
of O
bullets O
at O
the O
train, O
almost O
killing O
Lili O
in O
the O
process. O
Brilliant. O
What's O
also O
funny B-HUMOR
about O
that O
scene O
is O
the O
two O
leave O
on O
the O
train O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night B-STORY
but O
Hudson O
and O
his O
squadron O
reach O
the O
train O
even O
though O
they O
fly O
off O
the O
next O
morning. O
That's O
one O
slow B-TONE
moving O
train O
there. O
<br O
/><br O
/>The O
musical B-REMAKES
moments. O
The O
beginning O
is O
the O
best O
part O
of O
the O
entire O
film O
(and O
the O
reason O
I O
gave O
this O
film O
3 O
stars) O
but O
it's O
effect O
is O
diminished O
considerably O
because O
it's O
repeated O
at O
the O
end. O
Speaking O
of O
redundant, O
did O
we O
really O
need O
to O
see O
a O
can-can O
dance, O
Crepe O
Suzette O
stripping O
scene O
and O
Julie O
stripping O
too? O
The O
"Girl O
in O
no O
man's O
land" O
is O
OK O
even O
if O
it's O
bleeding O
obvious, O
but O
that O
moment O
just O
doesn't O
make O
any O
sense O
whatsoever O
because O
Lili O
sings O
it O
to O
a O
group O
of O
injured O
soldiers O
at O
a O
French O
hospital, O
making O
me O
wonder: O
how O
many O
soldiers O
there O
were O
injured O
indirectly O
by O
the O
result O
of O
her O
spying?<br O
/><br O
/>The O
whole O
project O
is O
listless O
and O
without O
energy. O
The O
romance B-STORY
is O
100% O
unbelievable. O
Rock O
Hudson O
is O
way O
too O
old O
and O
tired O
looking O
(check O
out O
the O
museum O
scene). O
Julie O
looks O
dazed, O
like O
she's O
on O
Valium. O
But O
what O
really O
kills O
this O
ill-conceived O
project O
is O
Julie O
playing O
a O
German O
spy. B-GENRE
Edwards B-DIRECTION
desperately O
wanted O
to O
dispel O
the O
Mary O
Poppins O
syndrome O
afflicting O
his O
wife O
and O
believed O
that O
playing O
a O
traitor O
was O
a O
good B-CAST
career O
decision. O
As O
much O
as O
I O
like O
Julie, O
she's O
no O
Greta O
Garbo, O
who O
pulled O
it O
off O
so O
beautifully O
in O
MATA O
HARI. O
Funny B-HUMOR
enough, O
even O
if O
Julie O
plays O
a O
German O
spy, B-GENRE
she O
still O
comes O
across O
as O
cloying O
and O
cute.<br O
/><br O
/>How O
bad O
is O
DARLING O
LILI? O
Even O
after O
37 O
years O
since O
its O
release, O
Blake O
Edwards B-DIRECTION
felt O
he O
still O
needed O
to O
work O
on O
it O
for O
its O
DVD O
release. O

This O
series, B-FRANCHISE
made O
for O
Televisión O
Española O
(TVE) O
is O
basically O
a O
series B-FRANCHISE
of O
chapters O
in O
the O
life O
of O
an O
ordinary O
family B-FRANCHISE
in O
1968, O
primarily O
as O
seen O
through O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
youngest O
son.<br O
/><br O
/>Based O
on O
a O
background O
of O
historical B-GENRE
events, O
such O
as O
the O
May O
1968 O
student B-GENRE
uprising O
in O
France, O
the O
decaying O
Franco O
regime, O
the O
war B-GENRE
in O
Viet-Nam, O
the O
rise O
of O
imperialism, O
and O
others O
specifically O
related O
to O
Spanish O
life O
at O
that O
particular O
moment, O
one O
might O
regard O
this O
series B-FRANCHISE
as O
a O
simple O
compilation O
of O
characteristic O
foibles O
which O
make O
themselves O
so O
apparent O
in O
this O
kind O
of O
entertainment.<br O
/><br O
/>Generally O
treated O
in O
a O
lightweight O
vein O
though O
not O
lacking O
in O
certain O
moments O
which O
might O
be O
called O
dramatic, O
the O
series B-FRANCHISE
would O
seem O
to O
be O
aimed O
at O
people O
of O
around O
fifty O
who O
can O
rember O
those O
times, O
as, O
it O
should O
be O
stated, O
anyone O
younger O
either O
chooses O
to O
ignore O
such O
happenings O
or O
is O
busily O
occupied O
in O
other O
things.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
best O
thing O
that O
can O
be O
said O
of O
this O
series B-FRANCHISE
is O
Ana O
Duato's O
rôle O
as O
mother O
of O
three O
children: O
she O
plays O
the O
part O
of O
the O
total O
housewife O
of O
the O
times O
really O
well, O
manifesting O
that O
peculiar B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
Spanish O
penchant, O
especially O
noticeable O
among O
women, O
of O
letting O
all O
her O
thinking O
and O
her O
doings O
be O
carried O
forward O
by O
the O
impetus O
of O
her O
heart, O
without O
any O
resorting O
to O
the O
use O
of O
the O
brain. O
As O
we O
say O
in O
Spain, O
common O
sense O
is O
one O
of O
the O
least O
common O
senses. O
Imanol O
Arias O
offers O
very O
little, O
apart O
from O
not O
being O
his O
usual O
stereotyped O
hard O
policeman O
as O
in O
other O
television O
series. B-FRANCHISE
Indeed, O
as O
an O
actor, B-CAST
he O
should O
not O
be O
trusted O
in O
anything O
which O
is O
not O
a O
TV O
series. B-FRANCHISE
His O
resources O
are O
too O
limited; O
however, O
his O
part O
as O
father O
of O
the O
working-class O
household O
is O
not O
at O
all O
bad.<br O
/><br O
/>Not O
really O
recommendable O
for O
other O
audiences, O
even O
Spanish-speakers O
in O
Latin O
America: O
the O
themes O
are O
all O
too O
parochially O
related O
to O
a O
specific O
spot O
in O
contemporary O
Spanish O
history, O
such O
that O
if O
the O
viewer O
was O
not O
living O
here O
at O
that O
time O
he O
will O
miss O
most O
of O
the O
references. O
It O
is O
even O
probable O
that O
certain O
situations O
which O
cause O
a O
few O
Spanish O
smiles O
would O
not O
mean O
anything O
to O
other O
viewers. O

I O
want O
the O
99 O
minutes O
of O
my O
life O
back O
that O
was O
wasted O
on O
this O
pathetic O
excuse O
for O
a O
movie. O
The O
acting B-CAST
was O
horrific! O
I O
used O
to O
be O
a O
fan O
of O
Cameron O
Diaz O
and O
Vincent O
D'Onofrio. O
I O
will O
never O
look O
at O
them O
the O
same O
again. O
Keanu O
Reeves O
and O
Dan O
Aykroyd B-CAST
were O
not O
a O
surprise. O
Everyone O
knows O
they O
never O
could O
act. O
Thankfully, O
only O
Dan O
attempted O
an O
accent. O
His O
accent O
was O
a O
disaster O
as O
expected. O
I O
think O
he O
was O
either O
confused O
about O
the O
location O
of O
the O
film O
or O
had O
never O
actually O
spoken O
to O
anyone O
from O
Minnesota. O
I O
hope O
this O
review O
helps O
anyone O
who O
is O
undecided O
about O
what O
to O
do O
with O
their O
precious O
time. O
The O
only O
reason O
I O
was O
able O
to O
sit O
through O
the O
whole O
movie O
was O
because O
I O
was O
stuck O
somewhere O
without O
anything O
better O
to O
watch O
or O
read. O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
movies O
which O
has O
been O
overlooked O
by O
too O
many O
movie O
goers, O
an O
observation O
which O
mystifies O
me. O
Not O
only O
directed O
by O
the O
acclaimed O
Ang O
Lee,it O
had O
many O
young O
actors O
who O
were O
to O
become O
major O
stars, O
e.g., O
Tobey O
Maguire O
(before O
Spiderman), O
Skeet O
Ulrich O
(before O
Jericho), O
Jonathan O
Rhys O
Meyers O
(before O
Tudors), O
James O
Caviezel, O
Simon O
Baker, O
Mark O
Ruffalo, O
Jeffrey O
Wright, O
Tom O
Wilkinson, O
and O
Jewel. O
All O
of O
the O
acting B-CAST
was O
superb O
and O
each O
of O
the O
actors O
mentioned O
gave O
memorable B-MUSIC
performances, O
especially O
Meyers O
who O
portrayed O
an O
evil O
villain B-CLICHES
who O
killed O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
killing.<br O
/><br O
/>When O
the O
biographies O
and O
accomplishments O
of O
the O
director B-DIRECTION
( O
even O
when O
he O
won O
an O
academy O
award) O
and O
the O
actors O
are O
listed, O
this O
film O
is O
usually O
omitted O
from O
their O
past O
performances. O
I O
discovered O
the O
film O
on O
DVD O
by O
accident B-STORY
and O
it O
became O
one O
of O
my O
most O
often O
watched O
films. O
However, O
it O
is O
seldom O
every O
seen O
on O
cable. O
I O
look O
forward O
to O
reading O
what O
others O
suggest O
are O
the O
reasons O
this O
film O
is O
not O
well O
known. O

It's O
nice O
to O
see O
a O
romantic B-FRANCHISE
comedy B-GENRE
that O
does O
not O
have O
the O
prissy O
man O
lead, O
this O
has O
solid O
acting B-CAST
from O
both O
male O
leads O
and O
also O
from O
the O
female O
lead O
and O
although O
the O
story B-STORY
is O
a O
little O
long O
and O
a O
little O
cliché O
you O
cant O
help O
but O
like O
it.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
think O
the O
story B-STORY
was O
a O
little O
rushed O
at O
the O
end, O
but O
extending O
that O
would O
have O
made O
the O
story B-STORY
even O
longer. O
Superior O
to O
other O
romantic B-FRANCHISE
comedies O
such O
as O
100 O
days O
with O
Mr O
arrogant, O
and O
possibly O
tied O
with O
my O
tutor O
friend.<br O
/><br O
/>It O
would O
make O
an O
interesting O
introduction O
to O
Korean O
cinema, O
not O
as O
great O
as O
My O
sassy B-CLICHES
girl, O
but O
still O
good. B-CAST

Of O
all O
the O
movies O
of O
the O
seventies, O
none O
captured O
to O
truest O
essence O
of O
the O
good B-CAST
versus O
evil O
battle O
as O
did O
the O
Sentinel. O
I O
mean, O
yes, O
there O
were O
movies O
like O
the O
Exorcist, O
and O
other O
ones; O
but O
none O
of O
them O
captured O
the O
human O
element O
of O
the O
protagonist O
like O
this O
one. O
If O
you O
have O
time, O
check O
this O
one O
out. O
You O
may O
not O
be O
able O
to O
get O
past O
the O
dated B-CLICHES
devices O
as O
such, O
but O
this O
is O
a O
story B-STORY
worth O
getting O
into.Then O
there O
are O
all O
the O
stars O
and O
soon-to-be O
stars. O
My O
absolute O
favorites O
were O
Eli O
Wallach, O
Sylvia O
Miles, O
and O
Burgess O
Meredith. O
Then O
there O
are O
the O
subtle O
clues O
that O
lead O
to O
what's O
going O
on O
too. O
Pay O
close O
attention. O
I O
had O
to O
watch O
it O
four O
times O
to O
catch O
on O
to O
all O
the O
smaller O
weird O
statements O
like O
'black B-HUMOR
and O
white O
cat, O
black B-HUMOR
and O
white O
cake'. O
Plus, O
the O
books O
are O
really O
good B-CAST
as O
well. O
I'm O
just O
sorry O
that O
they're O
not O
going O
to O
turn O
the O
second O
book O
into O
a O
film. O
It's O
so O
scary O
that O
it O
would O
outdo O
this O
movie. O

This O
is O
apparently O
the O
second O
remake B-REMAKES
of O
this O
film, O
having O
been O
filmed O
before O
in O
1911 O
and O
1918. O
And, O
in O
so O
many O
ways O
it O
reminds O
me O
of O
the O
later O
film, O
A O
YANK O
AT O
OXFORD. O
Both O
films O
concern O
a O
conceited O
blow-hard O
who O
arrives O
at O
one O
of O
the O
top O
schools O
in O
the O
world O
and O
both, O
ultimately, O
show O
the O
blow-hard O
slowly O
learning O
about O
teamwork O
and O
decency. O
In O
this O
film, O
William O
Haines O
is O
"Tom O
Brown" O
and O
his O
main O
rival, O
"Bob" O
is O
played O
by O
Frances O
X. O
Bushman. O
And, O
in O
a O
supporting O
role O
is O
Jack O
Pickford--always O
remembered O
as O
the O
brother O
of O
Mary. O
Of O
these O
three, O
Pickford O
comes O
off O
the O
best, O
as O
the O
sympathetic O
loser O
who O
becomes O
Tom's O
pal--he O
actually O
has O
a O
few O
decent O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
as O
well O
as O
a O
dramatic O
moment O
just O
before O
the O
Big O
Game! O
All O
the O
standard O
clichés O
are O
there O
and O
the O
movie, O
because O
it O
was O
done O
so O
many O
times O
before O
and O
since, O
offers O
few O
surprises. O
However, O
it O
is O
pleasant O
film O
and O
is O
enjoyable O
viewing.<br O
/><br O
/>In O
my O
opinion, O
for O
a O
better O
silent B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
college O
film, O
try O
Harold O
Lloyd's O
THE O
FRESHMAN--it's O
football O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
are O
frankly O
more O
exciting O
and O
Harold O
is O
far O
more O
likable O
and O
sympathetic O
than O
the O
annoying O
Tom O
Brown. O
THE O
FRESHMAN O
is O
probably O
the O
best O
college O
picture O
you O
can O
find O
from O
the O
era. O
Another O
reason O
why O
BROWN O
AT O
HARVARD O
is O
a O
lesser O
picture O
is O
that O
William O
Haines O
played O
essentially O
the O
same O
unlikable O
and O
bombastic O
character O
with O
the O
same O
plot B-CLICHES
again O
and O
again O
and O
again O
(such O
as O
in O
WESTPOINT O
and O
THE O
SMART O
SET, O
among O
others)--and O
if O
you've O
seen O
one O
of O
these O
films, O
you've O
seen O
them O
all. O
Well O
made, O
but O
certainly O
NOT O
original! O
And, O
because O
it O
is O
just O
a O
rehash O
of O
his O
other O
films, O
anyone O
giving O
the O
film O
a O
score B-MUSIC
of O
10 O
is O
STRONGLY O
advised O
to O
see O
these O
other O
films.<br O
/><br O
/>4/25/08==I O
just O
checked O
and O
saw O
this O
this O
small O
film O
was O
the O
highest O
rated O
film O
on O
IMDb O
from O
the O
1920!! O
Talk O
about O
over-rated! O
There O
are O
dozens O
and O
dozens O
of O
better O
films--how O
this O
film O
got O
to O
be O
#1 O
is O
anyone's O
guess. O

This O
movie O
illustrates O
like O
no O
other O
the O
state O
of O
the O
Australian O
film O
industry O
and O
everything O
that's O
holding O
it O
back.<br O
/><br O
/>Awesome O
talent, O
outstanding O
performances O
(particularly O
by O
Victoria O
Hill), O
but O
a O
let O
down O
in O
practically O
every O
other O
way.<br O
/><br O
/>An O
"adaptation" B-REMAKES
of O
sorts, O
it O
brought O
nothing O
new O
to O
Macbeth O
(no, O
setting O
it O
in O
present-day O
Australia O
is O
not O
enough), O
and O
essentially, O
completely O
failed O
to O
justify O
its O
existence, O
apart O
from O
(let's O
face O
it, O
completely O
unnecessarily) O
paying O
homage O
to O
the O
original O
work. O
If O
there's O
one O
body O
of O
work O
that O
has O
been O
done O
(and O
done O
and O
done O
and O
done), O
it's O
Shakespeare's. O
So O
any O
adaptation, B-REMAKES
if O
it's O
not O
to O
be O
a O
self-indulgent O
and O
pointless O
exercise, O
needs O
to O
at O
least O
bring O
some O
new O
interpretation O
to O
the O
work.<br O
/><br O
/>And O
that's O
what O
this O
Macbeth O
fails O
to O
do. O
As O
it O
was O
done, O
this O
film O
has O
no O
contemporary O
relevance O
whatsoever. O
It's O
the O
same O
piece O
that O
we O
have O
seen O
countless O
(too O
many!) O
times O
before. O
Except O
with O
guns O
and O
in O
different O
outfits.<br O
/><br O
/>Apart O
from O
the O
fundamental O
blunder O
(no O
other O
way O
to O
put O
it) O
of O
keeping O
the O
original O
Shakespearian O
dialogue, O
one O
of O
the O
more O
cringeful O
moments O
of O
the O
movie O
is O
the O
prolonged O
and O
incredibly O
boring B-TONE
slow B-TONE
motion B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
shoot O
out O
towards O
the O
end, O
during O
which O
I O
completely O
tuned O
out, O
even O
though O
I O
was O
looking O
at O
the O
screen. O
I O
never O
thought O
I O
had O
a O
short B-CAST
attention O
span, O
but O
there O
you O
go.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
suppose O
the O
movie O
succeeds O
on O
its O
own, O
very O
limited O
terms. O
But O
as O
Australia O
continues O
to O
produce O
world-class O
acting B-CAST
talent, O
its O
movie-makers O
need O
to O
stop O
being O
proud O
of O
succeeding O
on O
limited O
terms, O
and O
actually O
set O
high O
enough O
standards O
to O
show O
that O
they O
respect O
for O
the O
kind O
of O
acting B-CAST
talent O
they O
work O
with.<br O
/><br O

shame. O
An O
absolute O
shame. O

terrific B-PERFORMANCE

It's O
too O
shallow O
in O
parts, O
and O
the O
ending O
feels O
less O
organic O
than O
tacked O

But O
it's O
a O
gut-splitting O
ride O
most O
of O
the O
way, O

employing O
great O

on O
the O
essence O

(DeVito B-CAST

to O
write O
the O
story B-STORY
of O
his O
life. O
Mr. O
Pinsky O
is O
probably O
the O
funniest O
character O
for O
laughs-per-minutes-on-screen, O
an O
ascot-wearing O
weirdo O
who O
sees O
literature O
as O
an O
excuse O
to O
write O
his O
opus: O
"100 O
Girls O
I'd O
Like O
To O
Pork."<br O
/><br O
/>Then O
there's O
DeVito's O
Owen O
Lift, O
who O
calls O
himself O
Professor O
Donner's O
"star O
pupil" O
even O
though O
the O
teacher O
won't O
read O
his O
work O
in O
class. O
Owen O
is O
a O
somewhat O
unusual O
character O
to O
star O
in O
a O
movie, O
a O
man-child O
in O
his O
late O
30s O
who O
lives O
with O
his O
overbearing O
mother, O
Anne O
Ramsey, O
who O
calls O
him O
"lardass" O
and O
other O
endearing O
sentiments. O
In O
any O
other O
movie, O
we'd O
be O
asked O
to O
feel O
sorry O
for O
Owen, O
but O
"Throw O
Momma O
From O
The O
Train" O
piles O
life's O
cruelties O
onto O
this O
sad O
sack O
for O
laughs O
and O
expects O
us O
to O
go O
along. O
That's O
one O
big O
reason O
why O
this O
film O
probably O
loses O
a O
lot O
of O
people.<br O
/><br O
/>For O
those O
of O
us O
who O
enjoy O
the O
humor O
of O
this O
character, O
even O
identifying O
with O
him, O
and O
take O
the O
rest O
of O
what O
we O
see O
here O
as O
a O
lark, O
it's O
not O
as O
big O
a O
stretch O
to O
go O
along O
with O
the O
bigger O
gambit O
this O
comedy B-GENRE
takes, O
asking O
us O
to O
watch O
in O
amusement O
while O
Owen O
enlists O
Professor O
Donner's O
help O
in O
a O
plan O
to O
kill O
his O
mother. O
Actually, O
he O
first O
goes O
to O
Hawaii O
to O
kill O
Donner's O
hated O
ex, O
then O
tells O
the O
professor O
it's O
his O
turn O
to O
kill O
Mrs. O
Lift, O
"swapping O
murders" B-STORY
as O
seen O
in O
Hitchcock's O
"Strangers O
On O
A O
Train."<br O
/><br O
/>As O
a O
director, B-DIRECTION
DeVito B-CAST
not O
only O
complements O
his O
actors' O
performances O
with O
scene-setting O
that O
places O
the O
accent O
on O
dialogue, O
he O
makes O
some O
bold O
visual B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
statements, O
throwing O
in O
bits O
of O
amusing O
unreality O
to O
keep O
the O
audience O
on O
its O
toes O
(and O
away O
from O
taking O
things O
too O
seriously.)<br O
/><br O
/>Also O
helping O
matters O
is O
writer O
Stu O
Silver, O
who O
keeps O
the O
laughs O
coming O
with O
his O
quotable O
patter. O
"You O
got O
rats O
the O
size O
of O
Oldsmobiles O
here." O
"She's O
not O
a O
woman...She's O
the O
Terminator." O
"One O
little O
murder B-GENRE
and O
I'm O
Jack O
the O
Ripper." O
Those O
are O
all O
Crystal's O
words, O
but O
some O
of O
the O
funniest O
lines, O
which O
work O
only O
in O
context O
but O
absolutely O
kill, O
are O
DeVito's O
and O
Ramsey's. O
Apparently O
Silver O
never O
wrote O
another O
screenplay O
after O
this, O
according O
to O
the O
IMDb, O
and O
that's O
a O
shame, O
because O
he O
had O
real O
talent O
for O
it.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
best O
scene O
in O
this O
movie, O
when O
Crystal O
meets O
Ramsey, O
was O
actually O
used O
in O
its O
entirety O
as O
a O
theatrical O
'coming O
attraction' O
presentation, O
the O
only O
time O
I've O
seen O
a O
movie O
promoted O
that O
way. O
Owen O
introduces O
the O
professor O
to O
his O
mother O
as O
'Cousin O
Patty,' O
and O
when O
Momma O
says O
he O
doesn't O
have O
a O
Cousin O
Patty, O
panicky O
Owen O
loses O
it. O
'You O
lied O
to O
me,' O
he O
yells O
out, O
slamming O
the O
professor's O
forehead O
with O
a O
pan.<br O
/><br O
/>Of O
course, O
in O
reality O
the O
professor O
wouldn't O
groan O
out O
something O
witty O
from O
the O
floor, O
but O
'Throw O
Momma O
From O
The O
Train' O
works O
effectively O
at O
such O
moments, O
when O
playing O
its O
Looney O
Tunes O
vibe O
for O
all O
its O
worth. O
DeVito B-CAST
hasn't O
disappeared O
from O
films, O
of O
course, O
but O
it's O
a O
mystery B-STORY
why O
he O
hasn't O
really O
followed O
up O
on O
the O
directorial O
promise O
of O
this O
movie. O
Maybe O
it's O
because, O
as O
'Throw O
Momma O
From O
The O

lack O
of O
mainstream O
success O
shows, O
his O
kind O
of O

isn't O
to O
everyone's O

That's O
too O
bad O
for O

one O
of O
those O
rare O

that O
is O
completely O
under O

is O
totally O
worthwhile. O
It O
really O
reminds O
me O
of O
the O
old O
serials O
from O
the O
30s O
and O
40s. O
Which O
is O
why O
I'd O
have O
loved O
to O
see O
follow-up B-FRANCHISE
movies... O
but O
judging O
by O
the O
rest O
of O
Full O

there O
simply O
weren't O
enough O

two O
too O
many O
for O

is O
unfortunate, O

hadn't O
wandered O
off O

it's O
a O
shame O

could O
have O

a O

phenom. O

A O
truly O
muddled O

mess. O
Most O
things O
in O
the O

look O
more O

less O
like O

then O
there O
are O

licentious O
(even O

appropriately O
enough, O

asked O
why O
his O
entire O

even O
the O

the O
Mujahideen O
to O

the O
most O
important O
assistance O
the O

is O
the O
ability O
to O
shoot O
down O
the O
dreaded O
MI-21 O
helicopter O
gunships O
which O
rule O
the O

This O
takes O
money, O
lots O
of O
money, O
and O
eventually O
"Charlie's O
Team" O
covertly O
coerces O
those O
in O
Congress O
to O
fund O
the O
effort O
to O
the O
tune O
of O
$1 O
billion O
dollars O
for O
advanced O
weaponry O
to O
arm O
the O
Afghan O
rebels. O
This O
includes O
top-of-the-line, O
state-of-the-art O
anti-aircraft O
and O
anti-tank O
rockets O
as O
well O
as O
other O
highly O
sophisticated O
killing O
devices. O
Nasty, O
nasty O
stuff.<br O
/><br O
/>That O
this O
kind O
of O
multi-billion O
dollar O
illicit O
activity O
can O
and O
does O
take O
place O
behind O
Congressional O
doors O
is O
truly O
alarming. O
Every O
American O
should O
see O
this O
movie O
or O
read O
this O
book O
because O
it O
reveals O
a O
truly O
frightening O
aspect O
of O
the O
business-as-usual O
political B-GENRE
scene O
rarely O
seen O
outside O
the O
walls O
of O
our O
very O
own O
government. O
Oh O
momma, O
I O
wish O
it O
weren't O
so...<br O
/><br O
/>Even O
though O
the O
initial O
outcome O
for O
"Team O
Charlie" O
was O
an O
unqualified O
success, O
the O
unimaginable, O
unanticipated O
final O
result O
is O
that O
these O
sophisticated O
weapons O
are O
now O
used O
against O
our O
troops O
by O
the O
Taliban O
and O
others. O
Since O
the O
funding O
was O
entirely O
"covert," O
the O
young O
generation O
in O
this O
part O
of O
the O
world O
has O
no O
idea O
the O
fall O
of O
Soviet O
oppression O
and O
the O
end O
to O
Russian O
barbarity O
was O
the O
direct O
result O
of O
American O
intervention. O
Yes, O
once O
the O
Russkies O
left, O
so O
did O
our O
aid O
-- O
zip O
for O
schools, O
zip O
for O
infrastructure, O
zip O
on O
maintaining O
meaningful O
relationships O
with O
the O
Afghan O
people. O
As O
a O
result, O
the O
overall O
consequence O
is O
an O
unmitigated O
disaster O
-- O
it's O
like O
the O
forerunner O
to O
"Mission O
Accomplished."<br O
/><br O
/>As O
Nichol's B-DIRECTION
film O
so O
pointedly O
points O
out, O
"The O
ball O
you've O
set O
in O
motion B-SPECIAL_EFFECTS
can O
keep O
bouncing O
even O
after O
you've O
lost O
interest O
in O
it." O
Mike O
Krzyzewski O
knows O
this, O
Eva O
Longoria O
Parker O
knows O
this, O
little O
Lateesha O
in O
Lafayette O
knows O
this, O
but O
the O
typical O
American O
politician O
doesn't. O
So O
we O
go O
from O
good B-CAST
guys O
to O
bad O
guys O
because O
we O
couldn't O
let O
the O
world O
know O
we O
were O
the O
good B-CAST
guys. O
Talk O
about O
a O
Catch-22 O
(another O
Mike O
Nichols B-DIRECTION
film).<br O
/><br O
/>Perhaps O
Charlie O
Wilson O
said O
it O
best, O
"We O
f&%ked O
up O
the O
end O
game."<br O
/><br O
/>Again. O

I'm O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
surrealist O
art, B-GENRE
but O
this O
film O
by O
Bunuel O
(with O
some O
ideas O
from O
Dali) O
left O
me O
cold. O
Bunuel O
had O
a O
life-long O
grudge O
against O
the O
Catholic O
church O
and O
delighted O
in O
trying O
to O
offend O
Catholics O
in O
fairly O
silly O
ways. O
This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
silliest; O
almost O
like O
what O
you'd O
expect O
from O
a O
smart-aleck O
18-year-old O
in O
film O
class. O
The O
last O
few O
minutes O
of O
the O
movie, O
which O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
anything O
else, O
are O
a O
final O
nose-thumbing O
at O
religion.<br O
/><br O
/>If O
you O
read O
the O
"scholars" O
regarding O
this O
slow-paced, O
occasionally O
amusing O
film, O
it's O
all O
about O
how O
the O
church O
and O
society O
are O
guilty O
of O
sexual O
repression. O
If O
that O
is O
indeed O
the O
point, O
then O
Bunuel O
expresses O
it O
in O
the O
most O
roundabout O
fashion O
possible. O
The O
central O
male O
character O
is O
a O
nasty O
brute O
who O
loves O
kicking O
dogs O
and O
knocking O
blind O
men O
down O
in O
the O
street, O
and O
who O
mentally O
turns O
billboard O
ads O
into O
strange O
sexual O
fantasies. O
Is O
this O
behavior O
the O
church's O
fault O
(for O
interrupting O
his O
lovemaking), O
or O
is O
he O
just O
a O
jerk? O
I O
vote O
for O
the O
latter. O
I O
think O
Bunuel O
must O
have O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
personal O
hangups O
and O
chose O
the O
Catholics O
as O
the O
ones O
to O
blame.<br O
/><br O
/>There O
are O
a O
few O
moments O
where O
you O
might O
cry, O
"Aha! O
surrealism!": O
a O
cow O
in O
a O
bed, O
a O
giraffe O
falling O
out O
a O
window O
(a O
poor O
model), O
a O
man O
shredding O
a O
feather O
pillow, O
a O
woman O
flushing O
a O
toilet O
while O
we O
watch O
pictures O
of O
seething O
lava O
(or O
a O
mud O
pit...hard O
to O
tell O
in O
B/W). O
The O
rest O
is O
forgettable B-PERFORMANCE
self-indulgence. O
Unfortunately, O
Bunuel O
was O
still O
chasing O
the O
same O
bogey-men O
through O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
career O
(Viridiana, O
Discreet O
Charm...). O
If O
you're O
interested O
in O
seeing O
surrealism O
on O
the O
screen, O
check O
out O
Jean O
Cocteau's O
early O
work. O

This O
ludicrous O
film O
offers O
the O
standard O
1970's O
"hippie O
mentality" O
in O
a O
nut O
shell O
and O
bores O
us O
in O
the O
process. O
Its O
an O
attempt O
to O
rationalize O
absurd B-HUMOR

then O
one O

she O
decides O
that O
she O
is O
in O

with O
him. O
If O
you O
think O
that O
is O
superficial, O
the O
whole O

encapsulates O
such O
scenes. B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
She O
keeps O
saying O
how O
much O
she O
"loves" O
him O
and O
she O
only O
met O
him, O
it O
wears O
thin O
and O
really O
quick. O
I O
couldn't O
help O
but O
laugh O
throughout O
the O
film. O
Its O
obvious O
she's O
just O
using O
him O
as O
a O

the O

at O
one O
time. O
Also, O
the O
act O
of O
observation O
seems O
to O
affect O
the O
event. O
Solid O
particles O
can O
pass O
through O
barriers. O
All O
of O
this, O
so O
far, O
is O
accurate. O
But O
then O
they O
assert O
that O
that O
means O
that O
if O
you O
believed O
sincerely O
enough O
that O
you O
could O
walk O
through O
a O
wall, O
you O
could O
indeed O
do O
it. O
This O
is O
complete O
poppycock. O
Instead, O
the O
theory O
asserts O
that O
at O
our O
level, O
it O
is O
possible O
for O
you O
to O
walk O
through O
a O
wall, O
but O
it O
is O
merely O
by O
chance O
and O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
belief. O
Also O
you'd O
have O
to O
keep O
walking O
into O
the O
wall O
for O
eternity O
to O
ever O
have O
even O
the O
remotest O
chance O
of O
passing O
through O
the O
wall, O
the O
odds O
are O
so O
astronomically O
against O
it.<br O
/><br O
/>This O
is O
but O
one O
example O
of O
how O
they O
misrepresent O
the O
science. O
But O
much O
more O
annoying O
is O
the O
narrative B-STORY
involving O
an O
unhappy O
photographer, O
played O
by O
Marlee O
Maitlan. O
About O
halfway O
through O
the O
picture O
it O
becomes O
so O
confused O
as O
to O
be O
incomprehensible. O
Something O
to O
do O
with O
negative O
thoughts O
leading O
to O
addiction O
and O
self-hate. O
There O
may O
be O
some O
truth O
to O
that, O
but O
Quantum O
physics O
has O
nothing O
to O

with O
it.<br O

string O

the O
hot O

rent O

I O
was O
truly O
looking O
forward O
to O
this O
title. O
It O
sounded O
and O
looked O
fun. B-PERFORMANCE
The O
idea O
of O
someone O
making O
a O
cheesy B-HUMOR
50s O
monster O
movie O
could O
have O
been O
worth O
a O
few O
laughs, O
but O
instead O
this O
title O
only O
bores. O
First O
off, O
there O
is O
almost O
no O
Froggg O
in O
the O
entire O
movie O
which O
is O
the O
biggest O
disappointment. O
I O
have O
to O
sit O
through O
75+ O
minutes O
of O
lame O
drama B-GENRE
and O
dialog O
to O
get O
a O
few O
glimpses O
of O
the O
Froggg O
humping O
a O
bare O
breasted O
chick. O
Why? O
On O
top O
of O
that O
the O
film O
lacks O
any O
sort O
of O
fun B-PERFORMANCE
plot. B-CLICHES
I O
mean O
give O
me O
something O
thats O
a O
bit O
more O
interesting O
than O
just O
a O
bunch O

I O
wanted O
to O
see O
some O
hot O
chicks O
search O
for O
the O
creature O
in O

I O
wanted O

Geez, O

endless O

tiring O
dialog O
scenes B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
in O
a O
creature O
flick? O
My O
advice O
to O
the O
filmmakers: O
Keep O
going, O
your O
concepts O
are O
good, B-CAST
but O
your O
execution O
needs O
to O
be O
a O
lot O
more O
inspired. O
Have O
some O
fun B-PERFORMANCE
with O
the O
creature, O
put O
the O
humor O
in O
the O
action B-GENRE
and O
most O
important...put O
more O

this O

it O

too O
damn O
hard! O
It O
carries O
the O
appearance O
of O
a O
kids O
game, O
but O
you O
have O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
do O
tons O
of O
intricate O
moves O
that O
require O
you O
to O
twist B-CLICHES
and O
turn O
your O
hands O
into O
all O
sorts O
of O
awkward O
positions, O
and O
you O
have O
to O
search O
seemingly O
endless O
levels O
for O
100 O

to O
improve O
your O
'score'! B-MUSIC
You O
also O
have O
to O
find O
these O
impossibly O

that O
require O
you O
to O
do O
almost O
impossible O

I O
AM O

Chuck O
Jones's O
'Rabbit O
Seasoning', O
the O
second O
in O
the O
much O
beloved O
hunting O
trilogy, B-FRANCHISE
is O
often O
considered O
to O
be O
the O
best O
of O
the O
three. O
While O
I O
find O
it O
almost O
impossible O
to O
choose O
between O
this O
trio O
of O
fantastic O
cartoons, O
I O
would O
have O
to O
concede O
that O
'Rabbit O
Seasoning' O
is O
the O
most O
finely O
honed O
script. B-STORY
Here, O
the O
emphasis O
is O
placed O
on O
language O
as O
Bugs O
and O
Daffy O
run O
through O
a O
series B-FRANCHISE
of O
complex O
dialogues O
in O
the O
grand O
tradition O
of O
Abbot O
and O
Costello's O
'Who's O
on O
next' O
routine. O
As O
a O
long O
term O
Daffy O
fan, O
I O
have O
always O
been O
delighted O
by O
the O
hunting O
trilogy B-FRANCHISE
because O
it O
is O
consistently O
Daffy O
who O
gets O
all O
the O
best O
lines O
(the O
famous O
"Pronoun O
trouble" O
being O
one O
of O
the O
all O
time O
classics) O
and O
does O
most O
of O
the O
work. O
Bugs O
plays O
the O
role O
of O
cool B-MUSIC
manipulator O
while O
Elmer, O
as O
always, O
is O
the O
befuddled O
dupe. O
Part O
of O
what O
makes O
the O
hunting O
trilogy B-FRANCHISE
so O
much O
fun B-PERFORMANCE
is O
that O
Daffy O
and O
Elmer O
pose O
so O
little O
threat O
to O
Bugs O
that O
he O
is O
basically O
just O
kicking O
back O
and O
having O
some O
easy O
laughs. O
Elmer O
falls O
into O
every O
trap O
that O
is O
laid O
for O
him O
but O
it O
is O
poor O
old O
Daffy O
who O
comes O
off O
worst, O
being O
shot O
in O
the O
face O
again O
and O
again, O
his O
beak O
ending O
up O
in O
more O
and O
more O
ridiculous B-TONE
positions. O
It O
all O
builds O
to O
the O
inevitable O
climactic O
declaration O
"You're O
despicable". O
As O
intricate O
an O
example O
of O
Chuck O
Jones's O
impeccable O
timing O
as O
you'll O
come O
across, O
'Rabbit O
Seasoning' O
is O
a O
true O
classic. B-GENRE

A O
lovely O
little O
B O

all O
the O
usual O
Joe O
Lewis O
touches.... O
people O
ripping O
up O
pillows O
and O
auras O
of O
lurking O
fear. O
Also, O
alas, O
an O
ending O
that O
comes O
out O
of O
nowhere, O
because, O
apparently, O
the O
auteur O
has O
lost O
interest O
in O
the O
movie, O
or O
perhaps O
because O
as O
a O
B O
picture O
it O
has O
to O
fit O
into O
a O
slot. O

"Crossfire" O
is O
a O
justifiably O
famous O
1947 O
noir B-GENRE
that's O
a O
murder B-GENRE
mystery B-STORY
with O
a O

Sam O
Levene, O
and O
Gloria O

We O
witness O
the O
murder B-GENRE
in O
shadow O
at O
the O
beginning, O

for O

rest O
of O

/><br O
/>I O
don't O
know O
about O
1947, O
but O
seeing O
"Crossfire" O
today, O
one O
knows O
who O
did O
it O
and O
why O
the O
minute O
we O
see O
the O
suspects. O
I O
don't O
suppose O
it O
was O
so O
apparent O
back O
then, O
as O
these O
actors O
were O
just O
getting O
started. O
Nevertheless, O
the O
film O
packs O
a O
big O
punch O
with O
its O
powerful O
acting, B-CAST
good B-CAST
direction, B-DIRECTION
violence, B-GENRE
and O
unsparing O
anti-Semite O
language.<br O

characterizations O
are O
vivid, B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
including O
that O
of O
Gloria O
Grahame O
in O
a O
smallish O
role O
- O
she's O
a O

who O
meets O
Mitchell O

one O
of O
the O
suspect O
soldiers, O
in O
a O
bar O
and O
can O
provide O
him O
with O
an O
alibi. O
The O
big O
performance B-CAST
in O
the O
film O
belongs O
to O
Robert O
Ryan, O

everyone O

Robert O
Young O
especially O
is O
effective O

Rodolfo O
Sonego O
wrote O
screenplays O
for O
over O
50 O
years O
living O
in O
Italy. O
He O
was O
a O
great O
story B-STORY
teller O
and O
someone O
suggested O
that O
he O
put O
his O
stories O
into O
writing. B-STORY
So O
Rodolfo O
Sonego O
did. O
If O
you O
check O
out O
his O
biography, O
you O
can O
see O
the O
number O
of O
movies O
that O
have O
been O
made O
in O
Italy. O
Alberto O
Sordie O
was O
the O
main O
actor B-CAST
that O
starred O
in O
his O
stories. O
My O
uncle O
visited O
Australia O
and O
my O
town, O
in O
1968 O
to O
check O
out O
locations O
for O
"A O
girl O
in O
Australia" O
and O
created O
a O
great O
movie O
about O
a O
proxy O
bride O
after O
the O
second O
world O
war. B-GENRE
You O
can O
see O
his O
humor O
in O
all O
his O
movies. O
I O
found O
a O
copy O
of O
this O
movie O
on O
DVD O
recently. O
GREAT O

Goldeneye O
will O
always O
go O
down O
as O
one O
of O
thee O
most O
legendary O
games O
in O
VG O
history. O
Their O
is O
no O
doubt O
about O
that. O
But O
this O
game, O
although O
quite O
different, O
could O
quite O
possibly O
be O
the O
modern-day O
Bond O
champ, O
of O
its O
time.<br O
/><br O
/>This O
was O
not O
a O
bond O
game O
based O
on O
material O
from O
another O
medium. O
This O
was O
a O
completely O
new; O
scripted O
game. O
Which O
even O
had O
its O
own O
theme B-MUSIC
song! O
(wouldnt O
be O
bond O
without O
it, O
haha!) O
Gameplay O
was O
excellent, O
and O
if O
you're O
a O
fan O
of O
the O
bond O
games O
or O
films O
alike, O
you'll O
enjoy O
it.<br O
/><br O
/>Unlike O
some/most O
games, O
these O
cast B-CAST
members O
portrayed O
their O
characters B-CAST
themselves, O
as O
opposed O
to O
fictional O
creations O
for O
the O
game. O
Which O
gives O
it O
that O
more O
cinematic B-MUSIC
feel. O
With O
a O
very O
'bond'-able O
storyline, O
you O
feel O
like O
you're O
in O
the O
game O
as O
much O
as O
you O
get O
lost O
in O
a O
movie.<br O
/><br O
/>Enjoyable O
in O
all O
aspects, O
from O
start O
to O
finish. O
Even O
after O
beating O
the O
game O
there's O
still O
plenty O
more O
to O
be O
done. O
With O
the O
ranking O
system O
and O
unlockables O
to O
be O
achieved, O
as O
well O
as O
its O
multi-player O
missions, O
this O
is O
a O
stand-out O
game. O
Despite O
being O
quite O
old O
now, O
in O
video O
game O
years. O
It's O
still O
a O
good B-CAST
game O
that O
you O
can O
pick O
up O
& O
play O
whenever O
you O
feel O
the O
need O
to O
get O
a O
little O
more O
Bond O
in O
your O
life. O
Even O
now O
just O
thinking O
about O
it, O
I've O
got O
the O
theme B-MUSIC
song O
stuck O
in O
my O
head. O
Such O
a O
great O
cast B-CAST
and O
well-written O
storyline.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
story B-STORY
comes O
to O
life O
on O
the O
screen, O
almost O
as O
if O
the O
actors O
were O
their O
in O
front O
of O
you, O
and O
is O
every O
bit O
as O
entertaining O
as O
the O
game O
itself. O
Superbly O
done, O
in O
true O
bond O
fashion. O
Which O
can O
only O
be O
named O
Awesome, O
Completely O
Awesome.<br O
/><br O
/>I've O
gotta O
go O
throw O
this O
game O
on O
now. O
If O
you O
haven't O
played O
it O
yet, O
you're O
missing O
out! O

Helena O
Bonham O
Carter B-CAST
is O
the O
center O
of O
this O
movie. O
She O
plays O
her O
role O
almost O
immobile O
in O
a O
wheelchair O
but O
still O
brings O
across O
her O
traditional O
intensity. O
Kenneth O
Branagh O
was O
tolerable. O
The O
movie O
itself O
was O
good B-CAST
not O
exceptional. O
If O
you O
are O
a O
Helena O
Bonham O
Carter B-CAST
fan O
it O
is O
worth O
seeing. O

I O
commented O
on O
this O
when O
it O
first O
debuted O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
"thumbs O
in O
the O
middle" O
review, O
remarking O
that O
I'd O
give O
it O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
doubt O
beyond O
just O
the O
first O
episode. O
I've O
seen O
a O
total O
of O
six O
episodes O
now O
up O
to O
this O
point O
in O
June O
2006. O
And O
as O
a O
lifelong O
Batman O
fanatic, O
I O
can O
say O
without O
hesitation: O
this O
show O
is O
utter O
crap.<br O
/><br O
/>Everything's O
wrong O
with O
it. O
Everything. O
Getting O
past O
just O
the O
lousy O
animation O
and O
design, B-CINEMATOGRAPHY
the O
stories O
are O
ridiculously O
convoluted O
and O
with O
no O
character O
development O
or O
apparent O
interest O
by O
the O
writers O
of O
this O
dreck O
to O
give O
any O
substance O
to O
any O
stories.<br O
/><br O
/>And O
for O
God's O
sake...is O
it O
just O
me, O
or O
is O
the O
Joker O
in O
EVERY O
EPISODE?? O
Is O
Gotham O
that O
much O
of O
a O
revolving-door O
justice O
system? O
Or, O
again, O
is O
it O
just O
a O
complete O
lack O
of O
interest O
in O
the O
writers O
to O
put O
any O
effort O
into O
other O
villains O
(see O
"no O
character O
development", O
above).<br O
/><br O
/>And O
to O
make O
matters O
worse, O
every O
single O
Joker O
tale O
is O
the O
same O
3-part O
formula.<br O
/><br O
/>1) O
Joker O
gasses O
people.<br O
/><br O
/>2) O
Joker O
sets O
out O
to O
gas O
the O
whole O
city.<br O
/><br O
/>3) O
Batman O
saves O
the O
day.<br O
/><br O
/>Pfeh.<br O
/><br O
/>There O
was O
one O
episode O
I O
saw O
that O
wasn't O
a O
Joker O
story. B-STORY
The O
title O
escapes O
me, O
but O
the O
villain B-CLICHES
was O
that O
nefarious O
Cluemaster...the O
"Think O
Thank O
Thunk" O
episode O
with O
the O
quiz O
show. O
That O
was O
the O
single-worst O
Batman O
story B-STORY
I've O
ever O
seen, O
heard O
or O
read. O
Yes, O
worse O
than O
"I've O
Got O
Batman O
in O
My O
Basement." O
<br O
/><br O
/>I O
can't O
really O
say O
what O
I O
feel O
this O
show O
is O
because O
it's O
probably O
against O
the O
ToS, O
but O
it O
starts O
with O
"B" O
and O
rhymes O
with O
"fastardization". O
Thank O
goodness O
for O
the O
existence O
of O
the O
Timm/Dini/etc. O
era O
of O
Bat-entertainment, O
back O
from O
the O
Fox O
and O
Kids O
WB O
days. O
Stuff O
that O
good, B-CAST
and O
I O
should O
have O
known O
this, O
just O
couldn't O
possibly O
have O
lasted O
forever, O
unfortunately. O

Just O
because O
someone O
is O
under O
the O
age O
of O
10 O
does O
not O
mean O
they O
are O
stupid. O
If O
your O
child O
likes O
this O
film O
you'd O
better O
have O
him/her O
tested. O
I O
am O
continually O
amazed O
at O
how O
so O
many O
people O
can O
be O
involved O
in O
something O
that O
turns O
out O
so O
bad. O
This O
"film" O
is O
a O
showcase O
for O
digital O
wizardry O
AND O
NOTHING O
ELSE. O
The O
writing B-STORY
is O
horrid. O
I O
can't O
remember O
when O
I've O
heard O
such O
bad O
dialogue. O
The O
songs B-MUSIC
are O
beyond O
wretched. O
The O
acting B-CAST
is O
sub-par O
but O
then O
the O
actors O
were O
not O
given O
much. O
Who O
decided O
to O
employ O
Joey O
Fatone? O
He O
cannot O
sing O
and O
he O
is O
ugly O
as O
sin.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
worst O
thing O
is O
the O
obviousness O
of O
it O
all. O
It O
is O
as O
if O
the O
writers O
went O
out O
of O
their O
way O
to O
make O
it O
all O
as O
stupid O
as O
possible. O
Great O
children's O
movies O
are O
wicked, O
smart O
and O
full O
of O
wit O
- O
films O
like O
Shrek O
and O
Toy O
Story B-STORY
in O
recent O
years, O
Willie O
Wonka O
and O
The O
Witches O
to O
mention O
two O
of O
the O
past. O
But O
in O
the O
continual O
dumbing-down O
of O
American O
more O
are O
flocking O
to O
dreck O
like O
Finding O
Nemo O
(yes, O
that's O
right), O
the O
recent O
Charlie O
& O
The O
Chocolate O
Factory O
and O
eye-crossing O
trash O
like O
Red O
Riding O
Hood. O

"Hey O
Babu O
Riba" O
is O
a O
film O
about O
a O
young O
woman, O
Mariana O
(nicknamed O
"Esther" O
after O
a O
famous O
American O
movie O
star), O
and O
four O
young O
men, O
Glenn, O
Sacha, O
Kicha, O
and O
Pop, O
all O
perhaps O
15-17 O
years O
old O
in O
1953 O
Belgrade, O
Yugoslavia. O
The O
five O
are O
committed O
friends O
and O
crazy O
about O
jazz, B-MUSIC
blue O
jeans, O
or O
anything O
American O
it O
seems.<br O
/><br O
/>The O
very O
close O
relationship O
of O
the O
teenagers O
is O
poignant, O
and O
ultimately O
a O
sacrifice B-GENRE
is O
willingly O
made O
to O
try O
to O
help O
one O
of O
the O
group O
who O
has O
fallen O
on O
unexpected O
difficulties. O
In O
the O
wake O
of O
changing O
communist O
politics, O
they O
go O
their O
separate O
ways O
and O
reunite O
in O
1985 O
(the O
year O
before O
the O
film O
was O
made).<br O
/><br O
/>I O
enjoyed O
the O
film O
with O
some O
reservations. O
The O
subtitles O
for O
one O
thing O
were O
difficult. O
Especially O
in O
the O
beginning, O
there O
were O
a O
number O
of O
dialogues O
which O
had O
no O
subtitles O
at O
all. O
Perhaps O
the O
conversational O
pace O
required O
it, O
but O
I O
couldn't O
always O
both O
read O
the O
text O
and O
absorb O
the O
scene, O
which O
caused O
me O
to O
not O
always O
understand O
which O
character O
was O
involved. O
I O
watched O
the O
movie O
(a O
video O
from O
our O
public O
library) O
with O
a O
friend, O
and O
neither O
of O
us O
really O
understood O
part O
of O
the O
story B-STORY
about O
acquiring O
streptomycin O
for O
a O
sick O
relative.<br O
/><br O
/>This O
Yugoslavian O
coming O
of O
age O
film O
effectively O
conveyed O
the O
teenagers' O
sense O
of O
invulnerability, O
idealism, O
and O
strong O
and O
loyal O
bonds O
to O
each O
other. O
There O
is O
a O
main O
flashforward, O
and O
it O
was O
intriguing, O
keeping O
me O
guessing O
until O
the O
end O
as O
to O
who O
these O
characters B-CAST
were O
vis-a-vis O
the O
1953 O
cast, B-CAST
and O
what O
had O
actually O
happened.<br O
/><br O
/>I O
would O
rate O
it O
7 O
out O
of O
10, O
and O
would O
like O
to O
see O
other O
films O
by O
the O
director, B-DIRECTION
Jovan O
Acin O
(1941-1991). O

After O
a O
snowstorm, O
the O
roads O
are O
blocked O
and O
the O
highway O
patrolman O
Jason O
(Adam O
Beach) O
comes O
to O
the O
diner O
of O
his O
friend O
Fritz O
(Jurgen O
Prochnow) O
and O
advises O
his O
clients O
that O
they O
will O
only O
be O
able O
to O
follow O
their O
trips O
on O
the O
next O
day. O
Among O
the O
weird O
strangers, O
Jason O
meets O
his O
former O
sweetheart O
Nancy O
(Rose O
McGowan), O
who O
has O
just O
left O
her O
husband O
in O
Los O
Angeles. O
Along O
the O
night, B-STORY
without O
any O

with O
his O
base, O
Jason O
faces O
distressful O

suspicious O
situations O
with O

clients, O
and O
finds O
some O
corpses, O
indicating O
that O
among O
them O
there O
is O
a O
killer.<br O
/><br O
/>"The O
Last O
Stop" O
could O
be O
an O
average B-PERFORMANCE
thriller, B-GENRE
but O
the O
screenplay O
is O
simply O
awful. O
Most O
of O
the O
characters B-CAST
are O
despicable O
persons O
and O
the O
motives O
of O
the O
surprising O
serial O
killer O
are O
never O
disclosed, O
and O
the O
viewers O
have O
no O
further O
explanation O
why O
the O
killer O
decided O
to O
kill O
the O
guests. O
My O
vote O
is O
four.<br O
