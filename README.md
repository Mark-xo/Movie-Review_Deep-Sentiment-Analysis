# 🎬 Explainable AI for Deep Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to enhance sentiment analysis by providing **explainability** in **movie reviews**. Instead of just predicting whether a review is positive or negative, we break down *what specific aspects of the movie contributed to the sentiment*—whether it was the **music, cast, story, cinematography, or direction**.

We achieve this using:
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** fine-tuned on IMDb movie reviews to extract key aspects.
- **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)** to understand the impact of different aspects on the sentiment.
- **Attention Visualization** to see how our deep learning model focuses on different parts of the text.

## 📂 Dataset
We used the **IMDb movie review dataset**, which consists of **50,000 reviews** labeled as positive or negative.

We preprocess these reviews to:
- Identify aspects (e.g., *music*, *acting*, *story*).
- Extract relevant keywords.
- Associate sentiment scores to aspects.

## 🏗️ Architecture
1. **Fine-Tuned NER Model**: Parses movie reviews to classify words under aspects (e.g., "music", "acting").
2. **Sentiment Classifier**: Uses attention-based deep learning to classify the review.
3. **LIME XAI Model**: Highlights words that contribute most to the review’s sentiment.
4. **Attention Visualization**: Displays heatmaps showing which words influenced predictions.

## 📊 Key Features
- 🔍 **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**: Extracts what people liked or disliked in a movie.
- 🧠 **Explainable AI (XAI) Integration**: LIME shows which words influenced the sentiment.
- 🎨 **Attention Maps**: Visualizes how the model interprets reviews.
- 🏷️ **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Finds movie-related aspects dynamically.

📜 Key Findings
The NER model accurately identifies aspects like cinematography, acting, and story.
LIME explanations highlight words that most influence sentiment predictions.
Attention heatmaps provide a deeper understanding of how the model interprets text.

🚀 Future Work
Expand dataset support.
Improve aspect extraction using transformers.
Integrate additional XAI techniques (e.g., SHAP).
